However, pretraining such a strongmodel is difficult in the 3D point cloud field since the training data islimited and point cloud collection is expensive. This paper introducesEfficient Point Cloud Learning (EPCL), an effective and efficient point cloudlearner for directly training high-quality point cloud models with a frozenCLIP model. Our EPCL connects the 2D and 3D modalities by semantically aligningthe 2D features and point cloud features without paired 2D-3D data.Specifically, the input point cloud is divided into a sequence of tokens anddirectly fed into the frozen CLIP model to learn point cloud representation.Furthermore, we design a task token to narrow the gap between 2D images and 3Dpoint clouds. Comprehensive experiments on 3D detection, semantic segmentation,classification and few-shot learning demonstrate that the 2D CLIP model can bean efficient point cloud backbone and our method achieves state-of-the-artaccuracy on both real-world and synthetic downstream tasks. Code will beavailable.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02413v1.pdf>pointclip point cloud understanding by clip</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Recently, zero-shot and few-shot learning via Contrastive Vision-LanguagePre-training (CLIP) have shown inspirational performance on 2D visualrecognition, which learns to match images with their corresponding texts inopen-vocabulary settings. However, it remains under explored that whether CLIP,pre-trained by large-scale image-text pairs in 2D, can be generalized to 3Drecognition. In this paper, we identify such a setting is feasible by proposingPointCLIP, which conducts alignment between CLIP-encoded point cloud and 3Dcategory texts. Specifically, we encode a point cloud by projecting it intomulti-view depth maps without rendering, and aggregate the view-wise zero-shotprediction to achieve knowledge transfer from 2D to 3D. On top of that, wedesign an inter-view adapter to better extract the global feature andadaptively fuse the few-shot knowledge learned from 3D into CLIP pre-trained in2D. By just fine-tuning the lightweight adapter in the few-shot settings, theperformance of PointCLIP could be largely improved. In addition, we observe thecomplementary property between PointCLIP and classical 3D-supervised networks.By simple ensembling, PointCLIP boosts baseline&#x27;s performance and evensurpasses state-of-the-art models. Therefore, PointCLIP is a promisingalternative for effective 3D point cloud understanding via CLIP under lowresource cost and data regime. We conduct thorough experiments onwidely-adopted ModelNet10, ModelNet40 and the challenging ScanObjectNN todemonstrate the effectiveness of PointCLIP. The code is released athttps://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/PointCLIP.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01055v3.pdf>clip2point transfer clip to point cloud classification with imagedepth pretraining</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Pre-training across 3D vision and language remains under development becauseof limited training data. Recent works attempt to transfer vision-languagepre-training models to 3D vision. PointCLIP converts point cloud data tomulti-view depth maps, adopting CLIP for shape classification. However, itsperformance is restricted by the domain gap between rendered depth maps andimages, as well as the diversity of depth distributions. To address this issue,we propose CLIP2Point, an image-depth pre-training method by contrastivelearning to transfer CLIP to the 3D domain, and adapt it to point cloudclassification. We introduce a new depth rendering setting that forms a bettervisual effect, and then render 52,460 pairs of images and depth maps fromShapeNet for pre-training. The pre-training scheme of CLIP2Point combinescross-modality learning to enforce the depth features for capturing expressivevisual and textual features and intra-modality learning to enhance theinvariance of depth aggregation. Additionally, we propose a novel Dual-PathAdapter (DPA) module, i.e., a dual-path structure with simplified adapters forfew-shot learning. The dual-path structure allows the joint use of CLIP andCLIP2Point, and the simplified adapter can well fit few-shot tasks withoutpost-search. Experimental results show that CLIP2Point is effective intransferring CLIP knowledge to 3D vision. Our CLIP2Point outperforms PointCLIPand other self-supervised 3D networks, achieving state-of-the-art results onzero-shot and few-shot classification.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">1: attacks adversarial attack jailbreak vulnerabilities security injection robustness safety applications harmful malicious jailbreak_prompts prompt_injection integrated</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03348v1.pdf>scalable and transferable blackbox jailbreaks for language models via persona modulation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Despite efforts to align large language models to produce harmless responses,they are still vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that elicit unrestrictedbehaviour. In this work, we investigate persona modulation as a black-boxjailbreaking method to steer a target model to take on personalities that arewilling to comply with harmful instructions. Rather than manually craftingprompts for each persona, we automate the generation of jailbreaks using alanguage model assistant. We demonstrate a range of harmful completions madepossible by persona modulation, including detailed instructions forsynthesising methamphetamine, building a bomb, and laundering money. Theseautomated attacks achieve a harmful completion rate of 42.5% in GPT-4, which is185 times larger than before modulation (0.23%). These prompts also transfer toClaude 2 and Vicuna with harmful completion rates of 61.0% and 35.9%,respectively.

However, their extensive assimilation into various services introduces significant security risks. This study deconstructs the complexities and implications of prompt injection attacks on actual LLM-integrated applications. Initially, we conduct an exploratory analysis on ten commercial applications, highlighting the constraints of current attack strategies in practice. Prompted by these limitations, we subsequently formulate HouYi, a novel black-box prompt injection attack technique, which draws inspiration from traditional web injection attacks. HouYi is compartmentalized into three crucial elements: a seamlessly-incorporated pre-constructed prompt, an injection prompt inducing context partition, and a malicious payload designed to fulfill the attack objectives. Leveraging HouYi, we unveil previously unknown and severe attack outcomes, such as unrestricted arbitrary LLM usage and uncomplicated application prompt theft. We deploy HouYi on 36 actual LLM-integrated applications and discern 31 applications susceptible to prompt injection. 10 vendors have validated our discoveries, including Notion, which has the potential to impact millions of users. Our investigation illuminates both the possible risks of prompt injection attacks and the possible tactics for mitigation.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03825>do anything now characterizing and evaluating inthewild jailbreak prompts on large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The misuse of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention from the general public and LLM vendors. In response, efforts have been made to align LLMs with human values and intent use. However, a particular type of adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak prompt, has emerged and continuously evolved to bypass the safeguards and elicit harmful content from LLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study on jailbreak prompts in the wild, with 6,387 prompts collected from four platforms over six months. Leveraging natural language processing technologies and graph-based community detection methods, we discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from public platforms to private ones, posing new challenges for LLM vendors in proactive detection. To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Our experiments show that current LLMs and safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in all scenarios. Particularly, we identify two highly effective jailbreak prompts which achieve 0.99 attack success rates on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and they have persisted online for over 100 days. Our work sheds light on the severe and evolving threat landscape of jailbreak prompts. We hope our study can facilitate the research community and LLM vendors in promoting safer and regulated LLMs.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02926>demystifying rce vulnerabilities in llmintegrated apps</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across various downstream tasks. LLM-integrated frameworks, which serve as the essential infrastructure, have given rise to many LLM-integrated web apps. However, some of these frameworks suffer from Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on apps&#x27; servers remotely via prompt injections. Despite the severity of these vulnerabilities, no existing work has been conducted for a systematic investigation of them. This leaves a great challenge on how to detect vulnerabilities in frameworks as well as LLM-integrated apps in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we present two novel strategies, including 1) a static analysis-based tool called LLMSmith to scan the source code of the framework to detect potential RCE vulnerabilities and 2) a prompt-based automated testing approach to verify the vulnerability in LLM-integrated web apps. We discovered 13 vulnerabilities in 6 frameworks, including 12 RCE vulnerabilities and 1 arbitrary file read/write vulnerability. 11 of them are confirmed by the framework developers, resulting in the assignment of 7 CVE IDs. After testing 51 apps, we found vulnerabilities in 17 apps, 16 of which are vulnerable to RCE and 1 to SQL injection. We responsibly reported all 17 issues to the corresponding developers and received acknowledgments. Furthermore, we amplify the attack impact beyond achieving RCE by allowing attackers to exploit other app users (e.g. app responses hijacking, user API key leakage) without direct interaction between the attacker and the victim. Lastly, we propose some mitigating strategies for improving the security awareness of both framework and app developers, helping them to mitigate these risks effectively.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05274>fuzzllm a novel and universal fuzzing framework for proactively discovering jailbreak vulnerabilities in large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Jailbreak vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), which exploit meticulously crafted prompts to elicit content that violates service guidelines, have captured the attention of research communities. While model owners can defend against individual jailbreak prompts through safety training strategies, this relatively passive approach struggles to handle the broader category of similar jailbreaks. To tackle this issue, we introduce FuzzLLM, an automated fuzzing framework designed to proactively test and discover jailbreak vulnerabilities in LLMs. We utilize templates to capture the structural integrity of a prompt and isolate key features of a jailbreak class as constraints. By integrating different base classes into powerful combo attacks and varying the elements of constraints and prohibited questions, FuzzLLM enables efficient testing with reduced manual effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate FuzzLLM&#x27;s effectiveness and comprehensiveness in vulnerability discovery across various LLMs.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">2: llms llm large_language language large capabilities potential paper techniques introduce demonstrate approach gpt-4 like leveraging</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12940>selfexplanation prompting improves dialogue understanding in large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate users in executing various activities via multi-turn dialogues, but Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to comprehend these intricate contexts.

This study assesses the algorithmicfidelity and bias of LLMs by utilizing two nationally representative climatechange surveys. The LLMs were conditioned on demographics and/or psychologicalcovariates to simulate survey responses. The findings indicate that LLMs caneffectively capture presidential voting behaviors but encounter challenges inaccurately representing global warming perspectives when relevant covariatesare not included. GPT-4 exhibits improved performance when conditioned on bothdemographics and covariates. However, disparities emerge in LLM estimations ofthe views of certain groups, with LLMs tending to underestimate worry aboutglobal warming among Black Americans. While highlighting the potential of LLMsto aid social science research, these results underscore the importance ofmeticulous conditioning, model selection, survey question format, and biasassessment when employing LLMs for survey simulation. Further investigationinto prompt engineering and algorithm auditing is essential to harness thepower of LLMs while addressing their inherent limitations.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16361>large language models as data preprocessors</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), typified by OpenAI&#x27;s GPT series and Meta&#x27;s LLaMA variants, have marked a significant advancement in artificial intelligence. Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs are capable of understanding and generating human-like text across a diverse range of topics. This study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in data preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications. We delve into the applicability of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Vicuna-13B for error detection, data imputation, schema matching, and entity matching tasks. Alongside showcasing the inherent capabilities of LLMs, we highlight their limitations, particularly in terms of computational expense and inefficiency. We propose an LLM-based framework for data preprocessing, which integrates cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques, coupled with traditional methods like contextualization and feature selection, to improve the performance and efficiency of these models. The effectiveness of LLMs in data preprocessing is evaluated through an experimental study spanning 12 datasets. GPT-4 emerged as a standout, achieving 100\% accuracy or F1 score on 4 datasets, suggesting LLMs&#x27; immense potential in these tasks. Despite certain limitations, our study underscores the promise of LLMs in this domain and anticipates future developments to overcome current hurdles.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06094v1.pdf>leveraging large language models for scalable vector graphicsdriven image understanding</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements innatural language understanding and generation.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method with an external tool (Python REPL). We discovered that by prompting LLMs to generate structured text in XML-like markup language, we could seamlessly integrate CoT and the external tool and control the undesired behaviors of LLMs. With our approach, LLMs can utilize Python computation to rectify errors within CoT. We applied our method to ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) to solve challenging mathematical problems and demonstrated that combining CoT and Python REPL through the markup language enhances the reasoning capability of LLMs. Our approach enables LLMs to write the markup language and perform advanced mathematical reasoning using only zero-shot prompting.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">3: reinforcement rl reinforcement_learning computational et al reward inference number et_al adaptation length size gradient trained</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01247v2.pdf>do promptbased models really understand the meaning of their prompts</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Recently, a boom of papers has shown extraordinary progress in zero-shot andfew-shot learning with various prompt-based models. It is commonly argued thatprompts help models to learn faster in the same way that humans learn fasterwhen provided with task instructions expressed in natural language. In thisstudy, we experiment with over 30 prompt templates manually written for naturallanguage inference (NLI). We find that models learn just as fast with manyprompts that are intentionally irrelevant or even pathologically misleading asthey do with instructively &quot;good&quot; prompts. Further, such patterns hold even formodels as large as 175 billion parameters (Brown et al., 2020) as well as therecently proposed instruction-tuned models which are trained on hundreds ofprompts (Sanh et al., 2022). That is, instruction-tuned models often producegood predictions with irrelevant and misleading prompts even at zero shots.

Length controlled generation of LLMs emerges as an important topic, which enables users to fully leverage the capability of LLMs in more real-world scenarios like generating a proper answer or essay of a desired length. In addition, the autoregressive generation in LLMs is extremely time-consuming, while the ability of controlling this generated length can reduce the inference cost by limiting the length. Therefore, we propose a prompt-based length control method to achieve high-accuracy length controlled generation. In particular, we adopt reinforcement learning with the reward signal given by either trainable or rule-based reward models, which further enhances the length-control ability of LLMs by rewarding outputs that follows pre-defined control instruction. To enable rule-based inference, we also introduce standard prompt extractor to collect the standard control information from users&#x27; input. Experiments show that our method significantly improves the accuracy of prompt-based length control for summarization task on popular datasets like CNNDM and NYT. Both the standard prompt extractor and the RL-tuned model have show strong generalization ability to unseen control prompt templates.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15556v2.pdf>tcrallm token compression retrieval augmented large language model for inference cost reduction</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Since ChatGPT released its API for public use, the number of applicationsbuilt on top of commercial large language models (LLMs) increase exponentially.One popular usage of such models is leveraging its in-context learning abilityand generating responses given user queries leveraging knowledge obtained byretrieval augmentation. One problem of deploying commercial retrieval-augmentedLLMs is the cost due to the additionally retrieved context that largelyincreases the input token size of the LLMs. To mitigate this, we propose atoken compression scheme that includes two methods: summarization compressionand semantic compression. The first method applies a T5-based model that isfine-tuned by datasets generated using self-instruct containing samples withvarying lengths and reduce token size by doing summarization. The second methodfurther compresses the token size by removing words with lower impact on thesemantic. In order to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of the proposedmethods, we propose and utilize a dataset called Food-Recommendation DB (FRDB)focusing on food recommendation for women around pregnancy period or infants.Our summarization compression can reduce 65% of the retrieval token size withfurther 0.3% improvement on the accuracy; semantic compression provides a moreflexible way to trade-off the token size with performance, for which we canreduce the token size by 20% with only 1.6% of accuracy drop.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11200v2.pdf>bbtv2 towards a gradientfree future with large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Most downstream adaptation methods tune all or part of the parameters ofpre-trained models (PTMs) through gradient descent, where the tuning costincreases linearly with the growth of the model size. By contrast,gradient-free methods only require the forward computation of the PTM to tunethe prompt, retaining the benefits of efficient tuning and deployment. Though,past work on gradient-free tuning often introduces gradient descent to seek agood initialization of prompt and lacks versatility across tasks and PTMs. Inthis paper, we present BBTv2, an improved version of Black-Box Tuning, to drivePTMs for few-shot learning. We prepend continuous prompts to every layer of thePTM and propose a divide-and-conquer gradient-free algorithm to optimize theprompts at different layers alternately. Extensive experiments across varioustasks and PTMs show that BBTv2 can achieve comparable performance to full modeltuning and state-of-the-art parameter-efficient methods (e.g., Adapter, LoRA,BitFit, etc.) under few-shot settings while maintaining much fewer tunableparameters.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05736>llmlingua compressing prompts for accelerated inference of large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in various applications due to their astonishing capabilities.

We also propose twoways to improve their disambiguation capabilities, through a) in-contextlearning and b) fine-tuning on carefully curated ambiguous datasets.Experiments show that our methods can match or outperform state-of-the-artsystems such as DeepL and NLLB in four out of five language directions. Ourresearch provides valuable insights into effectively adapting LLMs to becomebetter disambiguators during Machine Translation.

However, in low-resource languages, obtaining such hand-picked exemplars can still be challenging, where unsupervised techniques may be necessary. Moreover, competent generative capabilities of LLMs are observed only in high-resource languages, while their performances among under-represented languages fall behind due to pre-training data imbalance. To elicit LLMs&#x27; ability onto low-resource languages without any supervised data, we propose to assemble synthetic exemplars from a diverse set of high-resource languages to prompt the LLMs to translate from any language into English. These prompts are then used to create intra-lingual exemplars to perform tasks in the target languages. Our unsupervised prompting method performs on par with supervised few-shot learning in LLMs of different sizes for translations between English and 13 Indic and 21 African low-resource languages. We also show that fine-tuning a 7B model on data generated from our method helps it perform competitively with a 175B model. In non-English translation tasks, our method even outperforms supervised prompting by up to 3 chrF++ in many low-resource languages. When evaluated on zero-shot multilingual summarization, our method surpasses other English-pivoting baselines by up to 4 ROUGE-L and is also favored by GPT-4.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13294v3.pdf>adaptive machine translation with large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Consistency is a key requirement of high-quality translation. It isespecially important to adhere to pre-approved terminology and adapt tocorrected translations in domain-specific projects. Machine translation (MT)has achieved significant progress in the area of domain adaptation. However,real-time adaptation remains challenging. Large-scale language models (LLMs)have recently shown interesting capabilities of in-context learning, where theylearn to replicate certain input-output text generation patterns, withoutfurther fine-tuning. By feeding an LLM at inference time with a prompt thatconsists of a list of translation pairs, it can then simulate the domain andstyle characteristics. This work aims to investigate how we can utilizein-context learning to improve real-time adaptive MT. Our extensive experimentsshow promising results at translation time. For example, LLMs can adapt to aset of in-domain sentence pairs and/or terminology while translating a newsentence. We observe that the translation quality with few-shot in-contextlearning can surpass that of strong encoder-decoder MT systems, especially forhigh-resource languages. Moreover, we investigate whether we can combine MTfrom strong encoder-decoder models with fuzzy matches, which can furtherimprove translation quality, especially for less supported languages. Weconduct our experiments across five diverse language pairs, namelyEnglish-to-Arabic (EN-AR), English-to-Chinese (EN-ZH), English-to-French(EN-FR), English-to-Kinyarwanda (EN-RW), and English-to-Spanish (EN-ES).</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">5: user recommendation foundation personalized foundation_models conversational mobile pfms interaction edge ui content systems services recommendations</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08782v2.pdf>sparks of gpts in edge intelligence for metaverse caching and inference for mobile aigc services</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Aiming at achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) for Metaverse,pretrained foundation models (PFMs), e.g., generative pretrained transformers(GPTs), can effectively provide various AI services, such as autonomousdriving, digital twins, and AI-generated content (AIGC) for extended reality.With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving, serving PFMs ofmobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable solution for caching andexecuting PFMs on edge servers with limited computing resources and GPU memory.However, PFMs typically consist of billions of parameters that are computationand memory-intensive for edge servers during loading and execution.

However, traditional recommender systems continue to face great challenges such as poor interactivity and explainability, which actually also hinder their broad deployment in real-world systems. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel paradigm called Chat-Rec (ChatGPT Augmented Recommender System) that innovatively augments LLMs for building conversational recommender systems by converting user profiles and historical interactions into prompts. Chat-Rec is demonstrated to be effective in learning user preferences and establishing connections between users and products through in-context learning, which also makes the recommendation process more interactive and explainable. What&#x27;s more, within the Chat-Rec framework, user&#x27;s preferences can transfer to different products for cross-domain recommendations, and prompt-based injection of information into LLMs can also handle the cold-start scenarios with new items. In our experiments, Chat-Rec effectively improve the results of top-k recommendations and performs better in zero-shot rating prediction task.

In this paper, we study the KG-augmented language model approach for solving the knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) task that requires rich world knowledge. Existing work has shown that retrieving KG knowledge to enhance LLMs prompting can significantly improve LLMs performance in KGQA. However, their approaches lack a well-formed verbalization of KG knowledge, i.e., they ignore the gap between KG representations and textual representations. To this end, we propose an answer-sensitive KG-to-Text approach that can transform KG knowledge into well-textualized statements most informative for KGQA. Based on this approach, we propose a KG-to-Text enhanced LLMs framework for solving the KGQA task.

As a kind of common methodfor this task, semantic parsing-based ones first convert natural languagequestions to logical forms (e.g., SPARQL queries) and then execute them onknowledge bases to get answers. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) haveshown strong abilities in language understanding and may be adopted as semanticparsers in such kinds of methods. However, in doing so, a great challenge forLLMs is to understand the schema of knowledge bases. Therefore, in this paper,we propose an In-Context Schema Understanding (ICSU) method for facilitatingLLMs to be used as a semantic parser in KBQA. Specifically, ICSU adopts theIn-context Learning mechanism to instruct LLMs to generate SPARQL queries withexamples. In order to retrieve appropriate examples from annotatedquestion-query pairs, which contain comprehensive schema information related toquestions, ICSU explores four different retrieval strategies.

While LLMs have demonstrated outstanding performance on atomic or linear (multi-hop) QA tasks, whether they can reason in knowledge-rich scenarios with interweaving constraints remains an underexplored problem. In this work, we propose geometric reasoning over structured knowledge, where pieces of knowledge are connected in a graph structure and models need to fill in the missing information. Such geometric knowledge reasoning would require the ability to handle structured knowledge, reason with uncertainty, verify facts, and backtrack when an error occurs. We propose Knowledge Crosswords, a multi-blank QA dataset where each problem consists of a natural language question representing the geometric constraints of an incomplete entity network, where LLMs are tasked with working out the missing entities while meeting all factual constraints. Knowledge Crosswords contains 2,101 individual problems, covering various knowledge domains and further divided into three difficulty levels. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate existing LLM prompting approaches on the Knowledge Crosswords benchmark. We additionally propose two new approaches, Staged Prompting and Verify-All, to augment LLMs&#x27; ability to backtrack and verify structured constraints. Our results demonstrate that while baseline approaches perform well on easier problems but struggle with hard ones, our proposed Verify-All outperforms other methods by a large margin and is more robust with hard problems. Further analysis reveals that LLMs&#x27; ability of geometric reasoning over structured knowledge is still far from robust or perfect, susceptible to confounders such as the order of options, certain structural patterns, assumption of existence of correct answer, and more.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">7: engineering prompt_engineering chatgpt research paper potential challenges methods analysis presents future domain provides provide systems</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00855>review of large vision models and visual prompt engineering</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Visual prompt engineering is a fundamental technology in the field of visual and image Artificial General Intelligence, serving as a key component for achieving zero-shot capabilities.

This study aimed to develop and externally validate a method using large language models to classify abstracts for diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic reviews, thereby reducing the human workload. We used a previously collected dataset for developing DTA abstract classifiers and applied prompt engineering. We developed an optimized meta-prompt for Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to classify abstracts. In the external validation dataset 1, the prompt with GPT-3.5 turbo showed a sensitivity of 0.988, and a specificity of 0.298. GPT-4 showed a sensitivity of 0.982, and a specificity of 0.677.

Short answer items typically consist of multiple sub-questions, and providing an analytic score and the text span relevant to each sub-question can increase the interpretability of the automated scores. Furthermore, they can be used to generate actionable feedback for students. Despite these advantages, most studies have focused on predicting only holistic scores due to the difficulty in constructing dataset with manual annotations.

Researchers widely rely on sentiment analysis to accomplishthis. However, recent research has show that sentiment analysis is only looselycorrelated with stance, if at all. This paper advances methods in text analysisby precisely defining the task of stance detection, providing a generalizedframework for the task, and then presenting three distinct approaches forperforming stance detection: supervised classification, zero-shotclassification with NLI classifiers, and in-context learning. In doing so, Idemonstrate how zero-shot and few-shot language classifiers can replace humanlabelers for a variety of tasks and discuss how their application andlimitations differ from supervised classifiers. Finally, I demonstrate anapplication of zero-shot stance detection by replicating Block Jr et al.(2022).</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03874v1.pdf>benchmarking a foundation llm on its ability to relabel structure names in accordance with the aapm tg263 report</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Purpose: To introduce the concept of using large language models (LLMs) tore-label structure names in accordance with the American Association ofPhysicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group (TG)-263 standard, and to establish abenchmark for future studies to reference.  Methods and Materials: The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-4application programming interface (API) was implemented as a Digital Imagingand Communications in Medicine (DICOM) storage server, which upon receiving astructure set DICOM file, prompts GPT-4 to re-label the structure names of bothtarget volumes and normal tissues according to the AAPM TG-263. Three diseasesites, prostate, head and neck, and thorax were selected for evaluation. Foreach disease site category, 150 patients were randomly selected for manuallytuning the instructions prompt (in batches of 50) and 50 patients were randomlyselected for evaluation. Structure names that were considered were those thatwere most likely to be relevant for studies utilizing structure contours formany patients.  Results: The overall re-labeling accuracy of both target volumes and normaltissues for prostate, head and neck, and thorax cases was 96.0%, 98.5%, and96.9% respectively. Re-labeling of target volumes was less accurate on averageexcept for prostate - 100%, 93.1%, and 91.1% respectively.  Conclusions: Given the accuracy of GPT-4 in re-labeling structure names ofboth target volumes and normal tissues as presented in this work, LLMs arepoised to be the preferred method for standardizing structure names inradiation oncology, especially considering the rapid advancements in LLMcapabilities that are likely to continue.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">10: language natural natural_language nlp tasks lms processing language_models lm nlp_tasks pretrained general powerful purpose techniques</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07664v1.pdf>rethink the effectiveness of text data augmentation an empirical analysis</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  In recent years, language models (LMs) have made remarkable progress inadvancing the field of natural language processing (NLP).

In this study, we evaluate theeffectiveness of three different FT methods in conjugation withback-translation across an array of 7 diverse NLP tasks, includingclassification and regression types, covering single-sentence and sentence-pairtasks. Contrary to prior assumptions that DA does not contribute to theenhancement of LMs&#x27; FT performance, our findings reveal that continuedpre-training on augmented data can effectively improve the FT performance ofthe downstream tasks.

There has been increasing interest in what knowledge these LMs contain and how we can extract that knowledge, treating LMs as knowledge bases (KBs). While there has been much work on probing LMs in the general domain, there has been little attention to whether these powerful LMs can be used as domain-specific KBs. To this end, we create the BioLAMA benchmark, which is comprised of 49K biomedical factual knowledge triples for probing biomedical LMs. We find that biomedical LMs with recently proposed probing methods can achieve up to 18.51% Acc@5 on retrieving biomedical knowledge. Although this seems promising given the task difficulty, our detailed analyses reveal that most predictions are highly correlated with prompt templates without any subjects, hence producing similar results on each relation and hindering their capabilities to be used as domain-specific KBs. We hope that BioLAMA can serve as a challenging benchmark for biomedical factual probing.</p></details><li><a href=https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.448.pdf>adaprompt adaptive model training for promptbased nlp</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Prompt-based learning, with its capability to tackle zero-shot and few-shot NLP tasks, has gained much attention in community. The main idea is to bridge the gap between NLP downstream tasks and language modeling (LM), by mapping these tasks into natural language prompts, which are then filled by pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, for prompt learning, there are still two salient gaps between NLP tasks and pretraining. First, prompt information is not necessarily sufficiently present during LM pretraining. Second, task-specific data are not necessarily well represented during pretraining. We address these two issues by proposing AdaPrompt, adaptively retrieving external data for continual pretraining of PLMs by making use of both task and prompt characteristics. In addition, we make use of knowledge in Natural Language Inference models for deriving adaptive verbalizers. Experimental results on five NLP benchmarks show that AdaPrompt can improve over standard PLMs in few-shot settings. In addition, in zero-shot settings, our method outperforms standard prompt-based methods by up to 26.35\% relative error reduction.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.12711>can large language models truly understand prompts a case study with negated prompts</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Previous work has shown that there exists a scaling law between the size of Language Models (LMs) and their zero-shot performance on different downstream NLP tasks. In this work, we show that this phenomenon does not hold when evaluating large LMs on tasks with negated prompts, but instead shows an inverse scaling law. We evaluate 9 different tasks with negated prompts on (1) pretrained LMs (OPT&amp;GPT-3) of varying sizes (125M - 175B), (2) LMs further pretrained to generalize to novel prompts (InstructGPT), (3) LMs provided with few-shot examples, and (4) LMs fine-tuned specifically on negated prompts; all LM types perform worse on negated prompts as they scale and show a huge performance gap between the human performance when comparing the average score on both original and negated prompts. By highlighting a critical limitation of existing LMs and methods, we urge the community to develop new approaches of developing LMs that actually follow the given instructions.

Such prior potentially impacts many vision tasks. For example, in conditional image synthesis, spatial conditions failing to adhere to the prior can result in visually inaccurate synthetic results. This work aims to explicitly learn the visual prior and enable the customization of sampling. Inspired by advances in language modeling, we propose to learn Visual prior via Generative Pre-Training, dubbed VisorGPT. By discretizing visual locations of objects, e.g., bounding boxes, human pose, and instance masks, into sequences, VisorGPT can model visual prior through likelihood maximization. Besides, prompt engineering is investigated to unify various visual locations and enable customized sampling of sequential outputs from the learned prior. Experimental results demonstrate that VisorGPT can effectively model the visual prior, which can be employed for many vision tasks, such as customizing accurate human pose for conditional image synthesis models like ControlNet.

However, existing CAM methods suffer from under-activation of target object regions and false-activation of background regions due to the fact that a lack of detailed supervision can hinder the model&#x27;s ability to understand the image as a whole. In this paper, we propose a novel Question-Answer Cross-Language-Image Matching framework for WSSS (QA-CLIMS), leveraging the vision-language foundation model to maximize the text-based understanding of images and guide the generation of activation maps. First, a series of carefully designed questions are posed to the VQA (Visual Question Answering) model with Question-Answer Prompt Engineering (QAPE) to generate a corpus of both foreground target objects and backgrounds that are adaptive to query images. We then employ contrastive learning in a Region Image Text Contrastive (RITC) network to compare the obtained foreground and background regions with the generated corpus. Our approach exploits the rich textual information from the open vocabulary as additional supervision, enabling the model to generate high-quality CAMs with a more complete object region and reduce false-activation of background regions. We conduct extensive analysis to validate the proposed method and show that our approach performs state-of-the-art on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09263v1.pdf>visionlanguage pretraining basics, recent advances, and future trends</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  This paper surveys vision-language pre-training (VLP) methods for multimodalintelligence that have been developed in the last few years.

Trained on a large segmentation dataset of over 1 billion masks, SAM is capable of segmenting any object on a certain image. In the original SAM work, the authors turned to zero-short transfer tasks (like edge detection) for evaluating the performance of SAM. Recently, numerous works have attempted to investigate the performance of SAM in various scenarios to recognize and segment objects. Moreover, numerous projects have emerged to show the versatility of SAM as a foundation model by combining it with other models, like Grounding DINO, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, etc. With the relevant papers and projects increasing exponentially, it is challenging for the readers to catch up with the development of SAM. To this end, this work conducts the first yet comprehensive survey on SAM. This is an ongoing project and we intend to update the manuscript on a regular basis.

LiST improves over recent methods that adopt prompt-basedfine-tuning (FN) using two key techniques. The first is the use ofself-training to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data for prompt-based FNin few-shot settings. We use self-training in conjunction with meta-learningfor re-weighting noisy pseudo-prompt labels. Self-training is expensive as itrequires updating all the model parameters repetitively. Therefore, we use asecond technique for light-weight fine-tuning where we introduce a small numberof task-specific parameters that are fine-tuned during self-training whilekeeping the PLM encoder frozen. Our experiments show that LiST can effectivelyleverage unlabeled data to improve the model performance for few-shot learning.Additionally, the fine-tuning is efficient as it only updates a smallpercentage of parameters and the overall model footprint is reduced sinceseveral tasks can share a common PLM encoder as backbone. A comprehensive studyon six NLU tasks demonstrate LiST to improve by 35% over classic fine-tuningand 6% over prompt-based FN with 96% reduction in number of trainableparameters when fine-tuned with no more than 30 labeled examples from eachtask.

However, standard prompt-based methods mainly consider the case of sufficient data of downstream tasks. It is still unclear whether the advantage can be transferred to the few-shot regime, where only limited data are available for each downstream task. Although some works have demonstrated the potential of prompt-tuning under the few-shot setting, the main stream methods via searching discrete prompts or tuning soft prompts with limited data are still very challenging. Through extensive empirical studies, we find that there is still a gap between prompt tuning and fully fine-tuning for few-shot learning. To bridge the gap, we propose a new prompt-tuning framework, called Soft Template Tuning (STT) 1. STT combines manual and auto prompts, and treats down-stream classification tasks as a masked language modeling task. Comprehensive evaluation on different settings suggests STT can close the gap between fine-tuning and prompt-based methods without introducing additional parameters. Significantly, it can even outperform the time- and resource-consuming fine-tuning method on sentiment classification tasks.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11961v2.pdf>attempt parameterefficient multitask tuning via attentional mixtures of soft prompts</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  This work introduces a new multi-task, parameter-efficient language model(LM) tuning method that learns to transfer knowledge across different tasks viaa mixture of soft prompts-small prefix embedding vectors pre-trained fordifferent tasks. Our method, called ATTEMPT (ATTEntional Mixtures of PromptTuning), obtains source prompts as encodings of large-scale source tasks into asmall number of parameters and trains an attention module to interpolate thesource prompts and a newly initialized target prompt for every instance in thetarget task. During training, only the target task prompt and the attentionweights, which are shared between tasks in multi-task training, are updated,while the original LM and source prompts are intact. ATTEMPT is highlyparameter-efficient (e.g., updates 2,300 times fewer parameters than fullfine-tuning) while achieving high task performance using knowledge fromhigh-resource tasks. Moreover, it is modular using pre-trained soft prompts,and can flexibly add or remove source prompts for effective knowledge transfer.Our experimental results across 21 diverse NLP datasets show that ATTEMPTsignificantly outperforms prompt tuning and outperforms or matches fullyfine-tuned or other parameter-efficient tuning approaches that use over tentimes more parameters.

Prior methods using language models have demonstrated promising results, but they still struggle to prove even middle school level theorems. One common limitation of these methods is that they assume a fixed theorem library during the whole theorem proving process. However, as we all know, creating new useful theorems or even new theories is not only helpful but crucial and necessary for advancing mathematics and proving harder and deeper results. In this work, we present LEGO-Prover, which employs a growing skill library containing verified lemmas as skills to augment the capability of LLMs used in theorem proving. By constructing the proof modularly, LEGO-Prover enables LLMs to utilize existing skills retrieved from the library and to create new skills during the proving process. These skills are further evolved (by prompting an LLM) to enrich the library on another scale. Modular and reusable skills are constantly added to the library to enable tackling increasingly intricate mathematical problems. Moreover, the learned library further bridges the gap between human proofs and formal proofs by making it easier to impute missing steps. LEGO-Prover advances the state-of-the-art pass rate on miniF2F-valid (48.0% to 57.0%) and miniF2F-test (45.5% to 47.1%). During the proving process, LEGO-Prover also manages to generate over 20,000 skills (theorems/lemmas) and adds them to the growing library. Our ablation study indicates that these newly added skills are indeed helpful for proving theorems, resulting in an improvement from a success rate of 47.1% to 50.4%.

The standardapproach for ICL is to prompt the LM with concatenated demonstrations followedby the test input. This approach suffers from some issues. First, concatenationoffers almost no control over the contribution of each demo to the modelprediction. This can be sub-optimal when some demonstrations are irrelevant tothe test example. Second, due to the input length limit of some transformermodels, it might be infeasible to fit many examples into the context,especially when dealing with long-input tasks.

However, LLM&#x27;sresponses may leak the sensitive private information contained in in-contextexemplars. To address this challenge, we propose Differentially PrivateIn-context Learning (DP-ICL), a general paradigm for privatizing ICL tasks. Thekey idea for DP-ICL paradigm is generating differentially private responsesthrough a noisy consensus among an ensemble of LLM&#x27;s responses based ondisjoint exemplar sets. Based on the general paradigm of DP-ICL, we instantiateseveral techniques showing how to privatize ICL for text classification andlanguage generation. We evaluate DP-ICL on four text classification benchmarksand two language generation tasks, and our empirical results show that DP-ICLachieves a strong utility-privacy tradeoff.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">15: shot zero learning shot_learning task performance setting results knowledge settings approaches art samples set given</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12730>citeprompt using prompts to identify citation intent in scientific papers</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Citations in scientific papers not only help us trace the intellectual lineage but also are a useful indicator of the scientific significance of the work.

The literature reports several signiﬁcant efforts to tackle this problem with limited or no access to previous task data. Among such efforts, typical solutions offer sophisticated techniques involving memory replay, knowledge distillation, model regularization, and dynamic network expansion. The resulting methods have a retraining cost at each learning task, dedicated memory requirements, and setting-speciﬁc design choices. In this work, we show that a frozen CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model offers as-tounding continual learning performance without any ﬁne-tuning (zero-shot eval-uation). We evaluate CLIP under a variety of settings including class-incremental, domain-incremental and task-agnostic incremental learning on ﬁve popular benchmarks (ImageNet-100 &amp; 1K, CORe50, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet). Without any bells and whistles, the CLIP model outperforms the state-of-the-art continual learning approaches in majority of the settings. We show the effect on CLIP model’s performance by varying text inputs with simple prompt templates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work to report the CLIP zero-shot performance in a continual setting. We advocate the use of this strong yet embarrass-ingly simple baseline for future comparisons in the continual learning tasks.

However, the rapid activity in e-commerce has led to the rapid emergence of new entities, which is difficult for general entity typing. Besides, product titles in e-commerce have very different language styles from text data in general domain. In order to handle new entities in product titles and address the special language styles of product titles in e-commerce domain, we propose our textual entailment model with continuous prompt tuning based hypotheses and fusion embeddings for e-commerce entity typing. First, we reformulate entity typing into a textual entailment problem to handle new entities that are not present during training. Second, we design a model to automatically generate textual entailment hypotheses using a continuous prompt tuning method, which can generate better textual entailment hypotheses without manual design. Third, we utilize the fusion embeddings of BERT embedding and Char-acterBERT embedding to solve the problem that the language styles of product titles in e-commerce are different from that of general domain. To analyze the effect of each contribution, we compare the performance of entity typing and textual entailment model, and conduct ablation studies on continuous prompt tuning and fusion embeddings. We also evaluate the impact of different prompt template initialization for the continuous prompt tuning.

To adopt prompt learning in the NER task, two kinds of methods have been explored from a pair of symmetric perspectives, populating the template by enumerating spans to predict their entity types or constructing type-specific prompts to locate entities. However, these methods not only require a multi-round prompting manner with a high time overhead and computational cost, but also require elaborate prompt templates, that are difficult to apply in practical scenarios. In this paper, we unify entity locating and entity typing into prompt learning, and design a dual-slot multi-prompt template with the position slot and type slot to prompt locating and typing respectively. Multiple prompts can be input to the model simultaneously, and then the model extracts all entities by parallel predictions on the slots. To assign labels for the slots during training, we design a dynamic template filling mechanism that uses the extended bipartite graph matching between prompts and the ground-truth entities. We conduct experiments in various settings, including resource-rich flat and nested NER datasets and low-resource in-domain and cross-domain datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves a significant performance improvement, especially in the cross-domain few-shot setting, which outperforms the state-of-the-art model by +7.7% on average.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11038v3.pdf>learning incontext learning for named entity recognition</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Named entity recognition in real-world applications suffers from thediversity of entity types, the emergence of new entity types, and the lack ofhigh-quality annotations. To address the above problems, this paper proposes anin-context learning-based NER approach, which can effectively inject in-contextNER ability into PLMs and recognize entities of novel types on-the-fly usingonly a few demonstrative instances. Specifically, we model PLMs as ameta-function $\mathcal{ \lambda_ {\text{instruction, demonstrations, text}}.M}$, and a new entity extractor can be implicitly constructed by applying newinstruction and demonstrations to PLMs, i.e., $\mathcal{ (\lambda .

However, such a paradigmis very inefficient for the task of slot tagging. Since slot tagging samplesare multiple consecutive words in a sentence, the prompting methods have toenumerate all n-grams token spans to find all the possible slots, which greatlyslows down the prediction. To tackle this, we introduce an inverse paradigm forprompting. Different from the classic prompts mapping tokens to labels, wereversely predict slot values given slot types. Such inverse prompting onlyrequires a one-turn prediction for each slot type and greatly speeds up theprediction. Besides, we propose a novel Iterative Prediction Strategy, fromwhich the model learns to refine predictions by considering the relationsbetween different slot types. We find, somewhat surprisingly, the proposedmethod not only predicts faster but also significantly improves the effect(improve over 6.1 F1-scores on 10-shot setting) and achieves newstate-of-the-art performance.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">17: extraction relation event information causal chatgpt task relations relation_extraction structured ie information_extraction temporal events extracting</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05454>zeroshot temporal relation extraction with chatgpt</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of temporal relation extraction is to infer the temporal relation between two events in the document.

We find that ChatGPT exhibits strong performance in detecting and reasoning about causal relations, while it may not be proficient in identifying the temporal order between two events.

Conventional prompt learning designs a prompt template to first predict an answer word and then maps it to the final decision. Unlike conventional prompts, we argue that predicting an answer word may not be a necessary prerequisite for the ECI task. Instead, we can first make a deterministic assumption on the existence of causal relation between two events and then evaluate its rationality to either accept or reject the assumption. The design motivation is to try the most utilization of the encyclopedia-like knowledge embedded in a pre-trained language model. In light of such considerations, we propose a deterministic assumption prompt learning model, called DAPrompt, for the ECI task. In particular, we design a simple deterministic assumption template concatenating with the input event pair, which includes two masks as predicted events&#x27; tokens. We use the probabilities of predicted events to evaluate the assumption rationality for the final event causality decision.

Despite the impressive emerging ability of ChatGPT in various NLP tasks, it is unclear how well ChatGPT performs in causal reasoning. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the ChatGPT&#x27;s causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments show that ChatGPT is not a good causal reasoner, but a good causal explainer. Besides, ChatGPT has a serious hallucination on causal reasoning, possibly due to the reporting biases between causal and non-causal relationships in natural language, as well as ChatGPT&#x27;s upgrading processes, such as RLHF. The In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques can further exacerbate such causal hallucination. Additionally, the causal reasoning ability of ChatGPT is sensitive to the words used to express the causal concept in prompts, and close-ended prompts perform better than open-ended prompts. For events in sentences, ChatGPT excels at capturing explicit causality rather than implicit causality, and performs better in sentences with lower event density and smaller lexical distance between events.

The planning performance of LLMs is significantly improved via prompting techniques, such as in-context learning or re-prompting with state feedback, placing new importance on the token budget for the context window. An under-explored but natural next direction is to investigate LLMs as multi-robot task planners. However, long-horizon, heterogeneous multi-robot planning introduces new challenges of coordination while also pushing up against the limits of context window length. It is therefore critical to find token-efficient LLM planning frameworks that are also able to reason about the complexities of multi-robot coordination. In this work, we compare the task success rate and token efficiency of four multi-agent communication frameworks (centralized, decentralized, and two hybrid) as applied to four coordination-dependent multi-agent 2D task scenarios for increasing numbers of agents. We find that a hybrid framework achieves better task success rates across all four tasks and scales better to more agents.

Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have emerged as a potential solution to this bottleneck by enabling researchers to explore human-driven interactions in previously unimaginable ways. Our research investigates simulations of human interactions using LLMs. Through prompt engineering, inspired by Park et al. (2023), we present two simulations of believable proxies of human behavior: a two-agent negotiation and a six-agent murder mystery game.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07505v2.pdf>data race detection using large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrating significant promise as analternate strategy to facilitate analyses and optimizations of high-performancecomputing programs, circumventing the need for resource-intensive manual toolcreation.

While there is a growing body of literature focusing on promptengineering, there is a lack of systematic analysis comparing the effects ofprompts across different models and tasks. To address this gap, we present acomprehensive prompt analysis based on the sensitivity of a function. Ouranalysis reveals that sensitivity is an unsupervised proxy for modelperformance, as it exhibits a strong negative correlation with accuracy. We usegradient-based saliency scores to empirically demonstrate how different promptsaffect the relevance of input tokens to the output, resulting in differentlevels of sensitivity. Furthermore, we introduce sensitivity-aware decodingwhich incorporates sensitivity estimation as a penalty term in the standardgreedy decoding. We show that this approach is particularly helpful wheninformation in the input is scarce.

In this empirical study, we conduct the most comprehensive analysis to date of prompt position option for natural language understanding tasks. Our findings quantify the substantial impact prompt position has on model performance. We observe that the prompt position used in prior studies is often sub-optimal for both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

This has motivated the development of strategies for automatically selecting effective language prompts. In this paper, we introduce prompt flatness, a new metric to quantify the expected utility of a language prompt. This metric is inspired by flatness regularization in statistical learning that quantifies the robustness of the model towards its parameter perturbations. We provide theoretical foundations for this metric and its relationship with other prompt selection metrics, providing a comprehensive understanding of existing methods. Empirically, we show that combining prompt flatness with existing metrics improves both performance and sample efficiency. Our metric outperforms the previous prompt selection metrics with an average increase of 5% in accuracy and 10% in Pearson correlation across 6 classification benchmarks.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11853v2.pdf>how to prompt llms for texttosql a study in zeroshot, singledomain, and crossdomain settings</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning have demonstratedremarkable capability in the text-to-SQL task.

While understanding why CoT prompting is effective is crucial to ensuring that this phenomenon is a consequence of desired model behavior, little work has addressed this; nonetheless, such an understanding is a critical prerequisite for responsible model deployment. We address this question by leveraging gradient-based feature attribution methods which produce saliency scores that capture the influence of input tokens on model output. Specifically, we probe several open-source LLMs to investigate whether CoT prompting affects the relative importances they assign to particular input tokens. Our results indicate that while CoT prompting does not increase the magnitude of saliency scores attributed to semantically relevant tokens in the prompt compared to standard few-shot prompting, it increases the robustness of saliency scores to question perturbations and variations in model output.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">21: language fine sentence grained attributes bert fashion level sentences representation linguistic control capture roberta representations</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05051>fashionsap symbols and attributes prompt for finegrained fashion visionlanguage pretraining</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fashion vision-language pre-training models have shown efficacy for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, general vision-language pre-training models pay less attention to fine-grained domain features, while these features are important in distinguishing the specific domain tasks from general tasks. We propose a method for fine-grained fashion vision-language pre-training based on fashion Symbols and Attributes Prompt (FashionSAP) to model fine-grained multi-modalities fashion attributes and characteristics. Firstly, we propose the fashion symbols, a novel abstract fashion concept layer, to represent different fashion items and to generalize various kinds of fine- grained fashion features, making modelling fine-grained attributes more effective. Secondly, the attributes prompt method is proposed to make the model learn specific attributes of fashion items explicitly. We design proper prompt templates according to the format of fashion data. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two public fashion benchmarks, i.e., FashionGen and FashionIQ, and FashionSAP gets SOTA performances for four popular fashion tasks. The ablation study also shows the proposed abstract fashion symbols, and the attribute prompt method enables the model to acquire fine-grained semantics in the fashion domain effectively. The obvious performance gains from FashionSAP provide a new baseline for future fashion task research.11The source code is available at https://github.com/hssip/FashionSAP</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08979v1.pdf>language model acceptability judgements are not always robust to context</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Targeted syntactic evaluations of language models ask whether models showstable preferences for syntactically acceptable content over minimal-pairunacceptable inputs. Most targeted syntactic evaluation datasets ask models tomake these judgements with just a single context-free sentence as input. Thisdoes not match language models&#x27; training regime, in which input sentences arealways highly contextualized by the surrounding corpus. This mismatch raises animportant question: how robust are models&#x27; syntactic judgements in differentcontexts? In this paper, we investigate the stability of language models&#x27;performance on targeted syntactic evaluations as we vary properties of theinput context: the length of the context, the types of syntactic phenomena itcontains, and whether or not there are violations of grammaticality. We findthat model judgements are generally robust when placed in randomly sampledlinguistic contexts. However, they are substantially unstable for contextscontaining syntactic structures matching those in the critical test content.Among all tested models (GPT-2 and five variants of OPT), we significantlyimprove models&#x27; judgements by providing contexts with matching syntacticstructures, and conversely significantly worsen them using unacceptablecontexts with matching but violated syntactic structures. This effect isamplified by the length of the context, except for unrelated inputs. We showthat these changes in model performance are not explainable by simple featuresmatching the context and the test inputs, such as lexical overlap anddependency overlap. This sensitivity to highly specific syntactic features ofthe context can only be explained by the models&#x27; implicit in-context learningabilities.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10198v2.pdf>moconvq unified physicsbased motion control via scalable discrete representations</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  In this work, we present MoConVQ, a novel unified framework for physics-basedmotion control leveraging scalable discrete representations.

In this paper, we examine the successes and limitationsof the GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 models in analysis of sentence meaningstructure, focusing on the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR; Banarescu etal. 2013) parsing formalism, which provides rich graphical representations ofsentence meaning structure while abstracting away from surface forms. Wecompare models&#x27; analysis of this semantic structure across two settings: 1)direct production of AMR parses based on zero- and few-shot prompts, and 2)indirect partial reconstruction of AMR via metalinguistic natural languagequeries (e.g., &quot;Identify the primary event of this sentence, and the predicatecorresponding to that event.&quot;). Across these settings, we find that models canreliably reproduce the basic format of AMR, and can often capture core event,argument, and modifier structure -- however, model outputs are prone tofrequent and major errors, and holistic analysis of parse acceptability showsthat even with few-shot demonstrations, models have virtually 0% success inproducing fully accurate parses. Eliciting natural language responses producessimilar patterns of errors. Overall, our findings indicate that these modelsout-of-the-box can capture aspects of semantic structure, but there remain keylimitations in their ability to support fully accurate semantic analyses orparses.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11499>rcot detecting and rectifying factual inconsistency in reasoning by reversing chainofthought</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large language Models (LLMs) have achieved promising performance on arithmetic reasoning tasks by incorporating step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. However, LLMs face challenges in maintaining factual consistency during reasoning, exhibiting tendencies to condition overlooking, question misinterpretation, and condition hallucination over given problems. Existing methods use coarse-grained feedback (e.g., whether the answer is correct) to improve factual consistency. In this work, we propose RCoT (Reversing Chain-of-Thought), a novel method to improve LLMs&#x27; reasoning abilities by automatically detecting and rectifying factual inconsistency in LLMs, generated solutions. To detect factual inconsistency, RCoT first asks LLMs to reconstruct the problem based on generated solutions. Then fine-grained comparisons between the original problem and the reconstructed problem expose the factual inconsistency in the original solutions. To rectify the solution, RCoT formulates detected factual inconsistency into fine-grained feedback to guide LLMs in revising solutions. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of RCoT over standard CoT, Self-Consistency and Self-Refine across seven arithmetic datasets. Moreover, we find that manually written fine-grained feedback can dramatically improve LLMs&#x27; reasoning abilities (e.g., ChatGPT reaches 94.6% accuracy on GSM8K), encouraging the community to further explore the fine-grained feedback generation methods.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">22: code generation sql code_generation programs software program programming python source state repair codex generating natural</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06599v3.pdf>structured chainofthought prompting for code generation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT) have shown impressiveperformance in code generation.

ChatGPT has shown great potential in software engineering to boost various traditional tasks such as program repair, code understanding, and code generation. However, whether automatic program repair (APR) applies to deep learning (DL) programs is still unknown. DL programs, whose decision logic is not explicitly encoded in the source code, have posed unique challenges to APR. While to repair DL programs, an APR approach needs to not only parse the source code syntactically but also needs to understand the code intention. With the best prior work, the performance of fault localization is still far less than satisfactory (only about 30\%). Therefore, in this paper, we explore ChatGPT&#x27;s capability for DL program repair by asking three research questions. (1) Can ChatGPT debug DL programs effectively? (2) How can ChatGPT&#x27;s repair performance be improved by prompting? (3) In which way can dialogue help facilitate the repair? On top of that, we categorize the common aspects useful for prompt design for DL program repair. Also, we propose various prompt templates to facilitate the performance and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT&#x27;s abilities such as detecting bad code smell, code refactoring, and detecting API misuse/deprecation.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08220>a lightweight framework for highquality code generation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, the use of automated source code generation utilizing transformer-based generative models has expanded, and these models can generate functional code according to the requirements of the developers. However, recent research revealed that these automatically generated source codes can contain vulnerabilities and other quality issues. Despite researchers&#x27; and practitioners&#x27; attempts to enhance code generation models, retraining and fine-tuning large language models is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Thus, we describe FRANC, a lightweight framework for recommending more secure and high-quality source code derived from transformer-based code generation models. FRANC includes a static filter to make the generated code compilable with heuristics and a quality-aware ranker to sort the code snippets based on a quality score. Moreover, the framework uses prompt engineering to fix persistent quality issues. We evaluated the framework with five Python and Java code generation models and six prompt datasets, including a newly created one in this work (SOEval). The static filter improves 9% to 46% Java suggestions and 10% to 43% Python suggestions regarding compilability. The average improvement over the NDCG@10 score for the ranking system is 0.0763, and the repairing techniques repair the highest 80% of prompts. FRANC takes, on average, 1.98 seconds for Java; for Python, it takes 0.08 seconds.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.11384v3.pdf>large language models are fewshot summarizers multiintent comment generation via incontext learning</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Code comment generation aims at generating natural language descriptions fora code snippet to facilitate developers&#x27; program comprehension activities.Despite being studied for a long time, a bottleneck for existing approaches isthat given a code snippet, they can only generate one comment while developersusually need to know information from diverse perspectives such as what is thefunctionality of this code snippet and how to use it. To tackle thislimitation, this study empirically investigates the feasibility of utilizinglarge language models (LLMs) to generate comments that can fulfill developers&#x27;diverse intents. Our intuition is based on the facts that (1) the code and itspairwise comment are used during the pre-training process of LLMs to build thesemantic connection between the natural language and programming language, and(2) comments in the real-world projects, which are collected for thepre-training, usually contain different developers&#x27; intents. We thus postulatethat the LLMs can already understand the code from different perspectives afterthe pre-training. Indeed, experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstratethe rationale of our insights: by adopting the in-context learning paradigm andgiving adequate prompts to the LLM (e.g., providing it with ten or moreexamples), the LLM can significantly outperform a state-of-the-art supervisedlearning approach on generating comments with multiple intents. Results alsoshow that customized strategies for constructing the prompts andpost-processing strategies for reranking the results can both boost the LLM&#x27;sperformances, which shed light on future research directions for using LLMs toachieve comment generation.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">23: human generated quality generation generate high based evaluation framework automatically responses text content response automatic</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13308v1.pdf>calibrating llmbased evaluator</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) on language modeling andemergent capabilities make them a promising reference-free evaluator of naturallanguage generation quality, and a competent alternative to human evaluation.However, hindered by the closed-source or high computational demand to host andtune, there is a lack of practice to further calibrate an off-the-shelfLLM-based evaluator towards better human alignment.

Still, as LLMs (and other generative models) generate more complex output, such as summaries, tables, or code, it becomes harder for the user to audit or evaluate the output for quality or correctness. Hence, we are seeing the emergence of tool-assisted experiences to help the user double-check a piece of AI-generated content. We refer to these as co-audit tools. Co-audit tools complement prompt engineering techniques: one helps the user construct the input prompt, while the other helps them check the output response. As a specific example, this paper describes recent research on co-audit tools for spreadsheet computations powered by generative models. We explain why co-audit experiences are essential for any application of generative AI where quality is important and errors are consequential (as is common in spreadsheet computations).

They also raise ethical concerns about the generation of fake media,data protection, privacy and ownership of AI-generated art. Since generative AIis already being used in products used by youth, it is critical that theyunderstand how these tools work and how they can be used or misused. In thiswork, we facilitated students&#x27; generative AI learning through expression oftheir imagined future identities. We designed a learning workshop - Dreamingwith AI - where students learned about the inner workings of generative AItools, used text-to-image generation algorithms to create their imaged futuredreams, reflected on the potential benefits and harms of generative AI toolsand voiced their opinions about policies for the use of these tools inclassrooms. In this paper, we present the learning activities and experiencesof 34 high school students who engaged in our workshops. Students reachedcreative learning objectives by using prompt engineering to create their futuredreams, gained technical knowledge by learning the abilities, limitations,text-visual mappings and applications of generative AI, and identified mostpotential societal benefits and harms of generative AI.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">25: understanding abilities patterns rule long time perspective common emergent term structures rules success sensitive dynamic</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01043v1.pdf>a survey of large language models for autonomous driving</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Autonomous driving technology, a catalyst for revolutionizing transportationand urban mobility, has the tend to transition from rule-based systems todata-driven strategies. Traditional module-based systems are constrained bycumulative errors among cascaded modules and inflexible pre-set rules. Incontrast, end-to-end autonomous driving systems have the potential to avoiderror accumulation due to their fully data-driven training process, althoughthey often lack transparency due to their ``black box&quot; nature, complicating thevalidation and traceability of decisions. Recently, large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated abilities including understanding context, logicalreasoning, and generating answers. A natural thought is to utilize theseabilities to empower autonomous driving. By combining LLM with foundationvision models, it could open the door to open-world understanding, reasoning,and few-shot learning, which current autonomous driving systems are lacking. Inthis paper, we systematically review a research line about \textit{LargeLanguage Models for Autonomous Driving (LLM4AD)}.

However,interacting with recent LMMs reveals major limitations that are hardly capturedby the current evaluation benchmarks. Indeed, task performances (e.g., VQAaccuracy) alone do not provide enough clues to understand their realcapabilities, limitations, and to which extent such models are aligned to humanexpectations. To refine our understanding of those flaws, we deviate from thecurrent evaluation paradigm and propose the EvALign-ICL framework, in which we(1) evaluate 8 recent open-source LMMs (based on the Flamingo architecture suchas OpenFlamingo and IDEFICS) on 5 different axes; hallucinations, abstention,compositionality, explainability and instruction following. Our evaluation onthese axes reveals major flaws in LMMs. To efficiently address these problems,and inspired by the success of in-context learning (ICL) in LLMs, (2) weexplore ICL as a solution and study how it affects these limitations. Based onour ICL study, (3) we push ICL further and propose new multimodal ICLapproaches such as; Multitask-ICL, Chain-of-Hindsight-ICL, andSelf-Correcting-ICL. Our findings are as follows; (1) Despite their success,LMMs have flaws that remain unsolved with scaling alone. (2) The effect of ICLon LMMs flaws is nuanced; despite its effectiveness for improvedexplainability, abstention, and instruction following, ICL does not improvecompositional abilities, and actually even amplifies hallucinations. (3) Theproposed ICL variants are promising as post-hoc approaches to efficientlytackle some of those flaws.

Dynamic graphs, which capturetemporal network evolution patterns, are ubiquitous in real-world web data.Evaluating LLMs&#x27; competence in understanding spatial-temporal information ondynamic graphs is essential for their adoption in web applications, whichremains unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we bridge the gap viaproposing to evaluate LLMs&#x27; spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamicgraphs, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time. Specifically, wepropose the LLM4DyG benchmark, which includes nine specially designed tasksconsidering the capability evaluation of LLMs from both temporal and spatialdimensions. Then, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts ofdifferent data generators, data statistics, prompting techniques, and LLMs onthe model performance. Finally, we propose Disentangled Spatial-TemporalThoughts (DST2) for LLMs on dynamic graphs to enhance LLMs&#x27; spatial-temporalunderstanding abilities. Our main observations are: 1) LLMs have preliminaryspatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs, 2) Dynamic graphtasks show increasing difficulties for LLMs as the graph size and densityincrease, while not sensitive to the time span and data generation mechanism,3) the proposed DST2 prompting method can help to improve LLMs&#x27;spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs for most tasks.

Here we capitalized on our previously described gene-to-metabolite network in order to engineer rosmarinic acid (RA) biosynthesis pathway for the production of beneficial RA and lithospermic acid B (LAB) in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures. Results showed their production was greatly elevated by (1) overexpression of single gene, including cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (c4h), tyrosine aminotransferase (tat), and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase (hppr), (2) overexpression of both tat and hppr, and (3) suppression of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (hppd). Co-expression of tat/hppr produced the most abundant RA (906 mg/liter) and LAB (992 mg/liter), which were 4.3 and 3.2-fold more than in their wild-type (wt) counterparts respectively. And the value of RA concentration was also higher than that reported before, that produced by means of nutrient medium optimization or elicitor treatment. It is the first report of boosting RA and LAB biosynthesis through genetic manipulation, providing an effective approach for their large-scale commercial production by using hairy root culture systems as bioreactors.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14122v2.pdf>beyond yes and no improving zeroshot llm rankers via scoring finegrained relevance labels</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Zero-shot text rankers powered by recent LLMs achieve remarkable rankingperformance by simply prompting. Existing prompts for pointwise LLM rankersmostly ask the model to choose from binary relevance labels like &quot;Yes&quot; and&quot;No&quot;. However, the lack of intermediate relevance label options may cause theLLM to provide noisy or biased answers for documents that are partiallyrelevant to the query. We propose to incorporate fine-grained relevance labelsinto the prompt for LLM rankers, enabling them to better differentiate amongdocuments with different levels of relevance to the query and thus derive amore accurate ranking. We study two variants of the prompt template, coupledwith different numbers of relevance levels.

This task is challenging due to the high-dimensional space of multi-label assignment (155,000+ ICD code candidates) and the long-tail challenge - Many ICD codes are infrequently assigned yet infrequent ICD codes are important clinically. This study addresses the long-tail challenge by transforming this multi-label classification task into an autoregressive generation task. Specifically, we first introduce a novel pretraining objective to generate free text diagnoses and procedures using the SOAP structure, the medical logic physicians use for note documentation. Second, instead of directly predicting the high dimensional space of ICD codes, our model generates the lower dimension of text descriptions, which then infers ICD codes. Third, we designed a novel prompt template for multi-label classification. We evaluate our Generation with Prompt (GPsoap) model with the benchmark of all code assignment (MIMIC-III-full) and few shot ICD code assignment evaluation benchmark (MIMIC-III-few). Experiments on MIMIC-III-few show that our model performs with a marco F130.2, which substantially outperforms the previous MIMIC-III-full SOTA model (marco F1 4.3) and the model specifically designed for few/zero shot setting (marco F1 18.7). Finally, we design a novel ensemble learner, a cross-attention reranker with prompts, to integrate previous SOTA and our best few-shot coding predictions. Experiments on MIMIC-III-full show that our ensemble learner substantially improves both macro and micro F1, from 10.4 to 14.6 and from 58.2 to 59.1, respectively.</p></details><li><a href=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/09/17/2023.09.14.557698.full.pdf>generating novel leads for drug discovery using llms with logical feedback</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used as repositories of biological and chemical information to generate pharmacological lead compounds. However, for LLMs to focus on specific drug targets typically require experimentation with progressively more refined prompts. Results thus become dependent not just on what is known about the target, but also on what is known about the prompt-engineering. In this paper, we separate the prompt into domain-constraints that can be written in a standard logical form, and a simple text-based query. We investigate whether LLMs can be guided, not by refining prompts manually, but by refining the the logical component automatically, keeping the query unchanged. We describe an iterative procedure LMLF (“Language Models with Logical Feedback”) in which the constraints are progressively refined using a logical notion of generalisation. On any iteration, newly generated instances are verified against the constraint, providing “logical-feedback” for the next iteration’s refinement of the constraints. We evaluate LMLF using two well-known targets (inhibition of the Janus Kinase 2; and Dopamine Receptor D2); and two different LLMs (GPT-3 and PaLM). We show that LMLF, starting with the same logical constraints and query text, can guide both LLMs to generate potential leads. We find: (a) Binding affinities of LMLF-generated molecules are skewed towards higher binding affinities than those from existing baselines; LMLF results in generating molecules that are skewed towards higher binding affinities than without logical feedback; (c) Assessment by a computational chemist suggests that LMLF generated compounds may be novel inhibitors. These findings suggest that LLMs with logical feedback may provide a mechanism for generating new leads without requiring the domain-specialist to acquire sophisticated skills in prompt-engineering.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06991>unsupervised contrastconsistent ranking with language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Language models contain ranking-based knowledge and are powerful solvers of in-context ranking tasks. For instance, they may have parametric knowledge about the ordering of countries by size or may be able to rank reviews by sentiment. Recent work focuses on pairwise, pointwise, and listwise prompting techniques to elicit a language model&#x27;s ranking knowledge. However, we find that even with careful calibration and constrained decoding, prompting-based techniques may not always be self-consistent in the rankings they produce. This motivates us to explore an alternative approach that is inspired by an unsupervised probing method called Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS). The idea is to train a probing model guided by a logical constraint: a model&#x27;s representation of a statement and its negation must be mapped to contrastive true-false poles consistently across multiple statements. We hypothesize that similar constraints apply to ranking tasks where all items are related via consistent pairwise or listwise comparisons. To this end, we extend the binary CCS method to Contrast-Consistent Ranking (CCR) by adapting existing ranking methods such as the Max-Margin Loss, Triplet Loss, and Ordinal Regression objective. Our results confirm that, for the same language model, CCR probing outperforms prompting and even performs on a par with prompting much larger language models.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">27: optimization tool tools prompt_optimization support emotion network human discrete metabolic demonstration documentation co gpt4 benefits</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09582>human emotion knowledge representation emerges in large language model and supports discrete emotion inference</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>How humans infer discrete emotions is a fundamental research question in the field of psychology. While conceptual knowledge about emotions (emotion knowledge) has been suggested to be essential for emotion inference, evidence to date is mostly indirect and inconclusive. As the large language models (LLMs) have been shown to support effective representations of various human conceptual knowledge, the present study further employed artificial neurons in LLMs to investigate the mechanism of human emotion inference. With artificial neurons activated by prompts, the LLM (RoBERTa) demonstrated a similar conceptual structure of 27 discrete emotions as that of human behaviors. Furthermore, the LLM-based conceptual structure revealed a human-like reliance on 14 underlying conceptual attributes of emotions for emotion inference. Most importantly, by manipulating attribute-specific neurons, we found that the corresponding LLM&#x27;s emotion inference performance deteriorated, and the performance deterioration was correlated to the effectiveness of representations of the conceptual attributes on the human side. Our findings provide direct evidence for the emergence of emotion knowledge representation in large language models and suggest its casual support for discrete emotion inference. # These authors contributed equally: liming16@tsinghua.org.cn, yushengsu.thu@gmail.com * Corresponding authors: {liuzy, dzhang}@tsinghua.edu.cn The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/thunlp/Model_Emotion.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00675>tool documentation enables zeroshot toolusage with large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Today, large language models (LLMs) are taught to use new tools by providing a few demonstrations of the tool&#x27;s usage. Unfortunately, demonstrations are hard to acquire, and can result in undesirable biased usage if the wrong demonstration is chosen. Even in the rare scenario that demonstrations are readily available, there is no principled selection protocol to determine how many and which ones to provide. As tasks grow more complex, the selection search grows combinatorially and invariably becomes intractable. Our work provides an alternative to demonstrations: tool documentation. We advocate the use of tool documentation, descriptions for the individual tool usage, over demonstrations. We substantiate our claim through three main empirical findings on 6 tasks across both vision and language modalities. First, on existing benchmarks, zero-shot prompts with only tool documentation are sufficient for eliciting proper tool usage, achieving performance on par with few-shot prompts. Second, on a newly collected realistic tool-use dataset with hundreds of available tool APIs, we show that tool documentation is significantly more valuable than demonstrations, with zero-shot documentation significantly outperforming few-shot without documentation. Third, we highlight the benefits of tool documentations by tackling image generation and video tracking using just-released unseen state-of-the-art models as tools. Finally, we highlight the possibility of using tool documentation to automatically enable new applications: by using nothing more than the documentation of GroundingDino, Stable Diffusion, XMem, and SAM, LLMs can re-invent the functionalities of the just-released Grounded-SAM and Track Anything models.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09582v4.pdf>languagespecific representation of emotionconcept knowledge causally supports emotion inference</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Understanding how language supports emotion inference remains a topic ofdebate in emotion science.

Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling.Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones.We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women.

We introduce a method for translating established, vetted social scientific constructs into AI objective functions, which we term societal objective functions, and demonstrate the method with application to the political science construct of anti-democratic attitudes. Traditionally, we have lacked observable outcomes to use to train such models, however, the social sciences have developed survey instruments and qualitative codebooks for these constructs, and their precision facilitates translation into detailed prompts for large language models. We apply this method to create a democratic attitude model that estimates the extent to which a social media post promotes anti-democratic attitudes, and test this democratic attitude model across three studies. In Study 1, we first test the attitudinal and behavioral effectiveness of the intervention among US partisans (N=1,380) by manually annotating (alpha=.895) social media posts with anti-democratic attitude scores and testing several feed ranking conditions based on these scores. Removal (d=.20) and downranking feeds (d=.25) reduced participants&#x27; partisan animosity without compromising their experience and engagement. In Study 2, we scale up the manual labels by creating the democratic attitude model, finding strong agreement with manual labels (rho=.75). Finally, in Study 3, we replicate Study 1 using the democratic attitude model instead of manual labels to test its attitudinal and behavioral impact (N=558), and again find that the feed downranking using the societal objective function reduced partisan animosity (d=.25). This method presents a novel strategy to draw on social science theory and methods to mitigate societal harms in social media AIs.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08573>casteist but not racist quantifying disparities in large language model bias between india and the west</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), now used daily by millions of users, can encode societal biases, exposing their users to representational harms. A large body of scholarship on LLM bias exists but it predominantly adopts a Western-centric frame and attends comparatively less to bias levels and potential harms in the Global South. In this paper, we quantify stereotypical bias in popular LLMs according to an Indian-centric frame and compare bias levels between the Indian and Western contexts. To do this, we develop a novel dataset which we call Indian-BhED (Indian Bias Evaluation Dataset), containing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples for caste and religion contexts. We find that the majority of LLMs tested are strongly biased towards stereotypes in the Indian context, especially as compared to the Western context.

However, current research on developing computational models of social norms has primarily focused on American society. Here, we propose a novel approach to discover and compare descriptive social norms across Chinese and American cultures. We demonstrate our approach by leveraging discussions on a Chinese Q&amp;A platform (Zhihu) and the existing SocialChemistry dataset as proxies for contrasting cultural axes, align social situations cross-culturally, and extract social norms from texts using in-context learning. Embedding Chain-of-Thought prompting in a human-AI collaborative framework, we build a high-quality dataset of 3,069 social norms aligned with social situations across Chinese and American cultures alongside corresponding free-text explanations. To test the ability of models to reason about social norms across cultures, we introduce the task of explainable social norm entailment, showing that existing models under 3B parameters have significant room for improvement in both automatic and human evaluation. Further analysis of cross-cultural norm differences based on our dataset shows empirical alignment with the social orientations framework, revealing several situational and descriptive nuances in norms across these cultures.</p></details><li><a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3526113.3545616>social simulacra creating populated prototypes for social computing systems</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Social computing prototypes probe the social behaviors that may arise in an envisioned system design. This prototyping practice is currently limited to recruiting small groups of people. Unfortunately, many challenges do not arise until a system is populated at a larger scale. Can a designer understand how a social system might behave when populated, and make adjustments to the design before the system falls prey to such challenges? We introduce social simulacra, a prototyping technique that generates a breadth of realistic social interactions that may emerge when a social computing system is populated. Social simulacra take as input the designer’s description of a community’s design—goal, rules, and member personas—and produce as output an instance of that design with simulated behavior, including posts, replies, and anti-social behaviors. We demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors that they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and that they enable exploration of “what if?” scenarios where community members or moderators intervene. To power social simulacra, we contribute techniques for prompting a large language model to generate thousands of distinct community members and their social interactions with each other; these techniques are enabled by the observation that large language models’ training data already includes a wide variety of positive and negative behavior on social media platforms. In evaluations, we show that participants are often unable to distinguish social simulacra from actual community behavior and that social computing designers successfully refine their social computing designs when using social simulacra.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">29: sentiment analysis constraints sentiment_analysis aspect financial truth publicly_available ground publicly aspects texts weak constraint available</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06629>instruction tuning for fewshot aspectbased sentiment analysis</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task which involves four elements from user-generated texts:aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, and sentiment polarity.

It however remains under-explored how the extracted aspects can help generate more meaningful recommendations to the users. Meanwhile, existing research on aspect-based recommendations often relies on separate aspect extraction models or assumes the aspects are given, without accounting for the fact the optimal set of aspects could be dependent on the recommendation task at hand. In this work, we propose to combine aspect extraction together with aspect-based recommendations in an end-to-end manner, achieving the two goals together in a single framework. For the aspect extraction component, we leverage the recent advances in large language models and design a new prompt learning mechanism to generate aspects for the end recommendation task. For the aspect-based recommendation component, the extracted aspects are concatenated with the usual user and item features used by the recommendation model. The recommendation task mediates the learning of the user embeddings and item embeddings, which are used as soft prompts to generate aspects. Therefore, the extracted aspects are personalized and contextualized by the recommendation task. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments on three industrial datasets, where our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both the personalized aspect extraction and aspect-based recommendation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate that it is necessary and beneficial to combine the learning of aspect extraction and aspect-based recommendation together. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of each design component in our framework.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10447v2.pdf>toward unified controllable text generation via regular expression instruction</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Controllable text generation is a fundamental aspect of natural languagegeneration, with numerous methods proposed for different constraint types.However, these approaches often require significant architectural or decodingmodifications, making them challenging to apply to additional constraints orresolve different constraint combinations.

Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like&quot;Let&#x27;s think step by step&quot;to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The other uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer. The superior performance of the second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs with the&quot;Let&#x27;s think step by step&quot;prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one, i.e., let&#x27;s think not just step by step, but also one by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we find that diversity matters for automatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT prompting method: Auto-CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct demonstrations. On ten public benchmark reasoning tasks with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently matches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.

However, the generated rationales often come with mistakes, making unfactual and unfaithful reasoning chains. To mitigate this brittleness, we propose a novel Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) prompting, where we aim at eliciting LLMs to generate explicit pieces of knowledge evidence in the form of structure triple. This is inspired by our human behaviors, i.e., we can draw a mind map or knowledge map as the reasoning evidence in the brain before answering a complex question. Benefiting from CoK, we additionally introduce a F^2-Verification method to estimate the reliability of the reasoning chains in terms of factuality and faithfulness. For the unreliable response, the wrong evidence can be indicated to prompt the LLM to rethink. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can further improve the performance of commonsense, factual, symbolic, and arithmetic reasoning tasks.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00618>synthetic prompting generating chainofthought demonstrations for large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large language models can perform various reasoning tasks by using chain-of-thought prompting, which guides them to find answers through step-by-step demonstrations. However, the quality of the prompts depends on the demonstrations given to the models, and creating many of them by hand is costly. We introduce Synthetic prompting, a method that leverages a few handcrafted examples to prompt the model to generate more examples by itself, and selects effective demonstrations to elicit better reasoning. Our method alternates between a backward and forward process to generate new examples. The backward process generates a question that match a sampled reasoning chain, so that the question is solvable and clear. The forward process produces a more detailed reasoning chain for the question, improving the quality of the example. We evaluate our method on numerical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks, and show that it outperforms existing prompting techniques.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10435>pal programaided language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to perform arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when provided with a few examples at test time (&quot;few-shot prompting&quot;). Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods such as&quot;chain-of-thought&#x27;&#x27;, which employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is decomposed correctly. In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other benchmarks. In all these natural language reasoning tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger models. For example, PAL using Codex achieves state-of-the-art few-shot accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing PaLM-540B which uses chain-of-thought by absolute 15% top-1.

These techniques search for proofs in the forward direction from axioms to the conclusion, which suffers from a combinatorial explosion of the search space, and thus high failure rates for problems requiring longer chains of reasoning. The classical automated reasoning literature has shown that reasoning in the backward direction (i.e. from intended conclusion to supporting axioms) is significantly more efficient at proof-finding. Importing this intuition into the LM setting, we develop a Backward Chaining algorithm, called LAMBADA, that decomposes reasoning into four sub-modules, that are simply implemented by few-shot prompted LLM inference. We show that LAMBADA achieves sizable accuracy boosts over state-of-the-art forward reasoning methods on two challenging logical reasoning datasets, particularly when deep and accurate proof chains are required.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">31: performance art accuracy state methods method based achieves time work propose improve simple prior compared</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13570v2.pdf>a simple baseline for knowledgebased visual question answering</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  This paper is on the problem of Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering(KB-VQA).

Compared to conventional adversarial defenses, VP allows us to design universal (i.e., data-agnostic) input prompting templates, which have plug-and-play capabilities at test time to achieve desired model performance without introducing much computation overhead. Although VP has been successfully applied to improving model generalization, it remains elusive whether and how it can be used to defend against adversarial attacks. We investigate this problem and show that the vanilla VP approach is not effective in adversarial defense since a universal input prompt lacks the capacity for robust learning against sample-specific adversarial perturbations. To circumvent it, we propose a new VP method, termed Class-wise Adversarial Visual Prompting (C-AVP), to generate class-wise visual prompts so as to not only leverage the strengths of ensemble prompts but also optimize their interrelations to improve model robustness. Our experiments show that C-AVP outperforms the conventional VP method, with 2.1× standard accuracy gain and 2× robust accuracy gain. Compared to classical test-time defenses, C-AVP also yields a 42× inference time speedup.

However, to attain optimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve alignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class descriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for deploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work Context Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the vision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve substantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes. Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient method for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of 5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to CoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11066v2.pdf>adversarial robustness of promptbased fewshot learning for natural language understanding</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  State-of-the-art few-shot learning (FSL) methods leverage prompt-basedfine-tuning to obtain remarkable results for natural language understanding(NLU) tasks. While much of the prior FSL methods focus on improving downstreamtask performance, there is a limited understanding of the adversarialrobustness of such methods. In this work, we conduct an extensive study ofseveral state-of-the-art FSL methods to assess their robustness to adversarialperturbations. To better understand the impact of various factors towardsrobustness (or the lack of it), we evaluate prompt-based FSL methods againstfully fine-tuned models for aspects such as the use of unlabeled data, multipleprompts, number of few-shot examples, model size and type. Our results on sixGLUE tasks indicate that compared to fully fine-tuned models, vanilla FSLmethods lead to a notable relative drop in task performance (i.e., are lessrobust) in the face of adversarial perturbations. However, using (i) unlabeleddata for prompt-based FSL and (ii) multiple prompts flip the trend. We furtherdemonstrate that increasing the number of few-shot examples and model size leadto increased adversarial robustness of vanilla FSL methods.

Four ofthe responses paired with human-written feedback were included in the prompt asexamples for GPT.

In stage two, we gave fourstudent researchers the 16 responses as well as two versions of feedback, onewritten by the authors and the other by GPT. Students were asked to rate thecorrectness and usefulness of each feedback, and to indicate which one wasgenerated by GPT. The results showed that students tended to rate the feedbackby human and GPT equally on correctness, but they all rated the feedback by GPTas more useful. Additionally, the successful rates of identifying GPT&#x27;sfeedback were low, ranging from 0.1 to 0.6. In stage three, we tasked GPT togenerate feedback to the rest of the student responses (n=65).

The study collected and analyzed the students&#x27; generative-AI tools, short stories, and written reflections on their conditions or purposes for prompting. The research identified three main themes regarding the purposes for which students prompt generative-AI tools during short story writing: a lack of awareness of purposes, overcoming writer&#x27;s block, and developing, expanding, and improving the story. The study also identified common characteristics of students&#x27; activity systems, including the sophistication of their generative-AI tools, the quality of their stories, and their school&#x27;s overall academic achievement level, for their prompting of generative-AI tools for the three purposes during short story writing.

Although it has potential to support English as a foreign language (EFL) students&#x27; writing, to effectively collaborate with it, a student must learn to engineer prompts, that is, the skill of crafting appropriate instructions so that ChatGPT produces desired outputs. However, writing an appropriate prompt for ChatGPT is not straightforward for non-technical users who suffer a trial-and-error process. This paper examines the content of EFL students&#x27; ChatGPT prompts when completing a writing task and explores patterns in the quality and quantity of the prompts. The data come from iPad screen recordings of secondary school EFL students who used ChatGPT and other SOTA chatbots for the first time to complete the same writing task. The paper presents a case study of four distinct pathways that illustrate the trial-and-error process and show different combinations of prompt content and quantity. The cases contribute evidence for the need to provide prompt engineering education in the context of the EFL writing classroom, if students are to move beyond an individual trial-and-error process, learning a greater variety of prompt content and more sophisticated prompts to support their writing.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18125>the utility of large language models and generative ai for education research</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in engineering education can provide valuable insights into the underlying processes involved in generating text. While accessing these insights can be labor-intensive if done manually, recent advances in NLP and large language models have made it a realistic option for individuals. This study explores and evaluates a combination of clustering, summarization, and prompting techniques to analyze over 1,000 student essays in which students discussed their career interests. The specific assignment prompted students to define and explain their career goals as engineers. Using text embedding representations of student responses, we clustered the responses together to identify thematically similar statements from students. The clustered responses were then summarized to quickly identify career interest themes. We also used a set of a priori codes about career satisfaction and sectors to demonstrate an alternative approach to using these generative text models to analyze student writing. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of NLP techniques in engineering education research. By automating the initial analysis of student essays, researchers and educators can more efficiently and accurately identify key themes and patterns in student writing.

The flexibility and emergent capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge of interest in automating portions of the tutoring process - including interactive QA to support conceptual discussion of mathematical concepts. However, LLM responses to math questions can be incorrect or mismatched to the educational context - such as being misaligned with a school&#x27;s curriculum. One potential solution is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which involves incorporating a vetted external knowledge source in the LLM prompt to increase response quality. In this paper, we designed prompts that retrieve and use content from a high-quality open-source math textbook to generate responses to real student questions. We evaluate the efficacy of this RAG system for middle-school algebra and geometry QA by administering a multi-condition survey, finding that humans prefer responses generated using RAG, but not when responses are too grounded in the textbook content. We argue that while RAG is able to improve response quality, designers of math QA systems must consider trade-offs between generating responses preferred by students and responses closely matched to specific educational resources.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">33: language large work use language_models large_language text new gpt-3 find perform better different ability set</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13782v1.pdf>images in language space exploring the suitability of large language models for vision &amp; language tasks</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Large language models have demonstrated robust performance on variouslanguage tasks using zero-shot or few-shot learning paradigms.

While optimizing compilers are a standard tool to help increase program efficiency, programmers continue to shoulder much responsibility in crafting and refactoring code with better performance characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to suggest functionally correct, performance improving code edits. We hypothesize that language models can suggest such edits in ways that would be impractical for static analysis alone. We investigate these questions by curating a large-scale dataset of Performance-Improving Edits, PIE. PIE contains trajectories of programs, where a programmer begins with an initial, slower version and iteratively makes changes to improve the program&#x27;s performance. We use PIE to evaluate and improve the capacity of large language models. Specifically, use examples from PIE to fine-tune multiple variants of CODEGEN, a billion-scale Transformer-decoder model. Additionally, we use examples from PIE to prompt OpenAI&#x27;s CODEX using a few-shot prompting. By leveraging PIE, we find that both CODEX and CODEGEN can generate performance-improving edits, with speedups of more than 2.5x for over 25% of the programs, for C++ and Python, even after the C++ programs were compiled using the O3 optimization level. Crucially, we show that PIE allows CODEGEN, an open-sourced and 10x smaller model than CODEX, to match the performance of CODEX on this challenging task. Overall, this work opens new doors for creating systems and methods that can help programmers write efficient code.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">34: answer self correct questions responses incorrect question given multiple false answers uncertainty choice assessment personality</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08163>investigating the applicability of selfassessment tests for personality measurement of large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As large language models (LLM) evolve in their capabilities, various recent studies have tried to quantify their behavior using psychological tools created to study human behavior. One such example is the measurement of&quot;personality&quot;of LLMs using personality self-assessment tests. In this paper, we take three such studies on personality measurement of LLMs that use personality self-assessment tests created to study human behavior. We use the prompts used in these three different papers to measure the personality of the same LLM. We find that all three prompts lead very different personality scores. This simple test reveals that personality self-assessment scores in LLMs depend on the subjective choice of the prompter. Since we don&#x27;t know the ground truth value of personality scores for LLMs as there is no correct answer to such questions, there&#x27;s no way of claiming if one prompt is more or less correct than the other. We then introduce the property of option order symmetry for personality measurement of LLMs. Since most of the self-assessment tests exist in the form of multiple choice question (MCQ) questions, we argue that the scores should also be robust to not just the prompt template but also the order in which the options are presented. This test unsurprisingly reveals that the answers to the self-assessment tests are not robust to the order of the options. These simple tests, done on ChatGPT and Llama2 models show that self-assessment personality tests created for humans are not appropriate for measuring personality in LLMs.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14596v2.pdf>increasing probability mass on answer choices does not always improve accuracy</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  When pretrained language models (LMs) are applied to discriminative taskssuch as multiple-choice questions, they place probability mass on vocabularytokens that aren&#x27;t among the given answer choices. Spreading probability massacross multiple surface forms with identical meaning (such as &quot;bath&quot; and&quot;bathtub&quot;) is thought to cause an underestimation of a model&#x27;s trueperformance, referred to as the &quot;surface form competition&quot; (SFC) hypothesis.This has motivated the introduction of various probability normalizationmethods. However, many core questions remain unanswered. How do we measure SFC?Are there direct ways of reducing it, and does doing so improve taskperformance?  We propose a mathematical formalism for SFC which allows us to quantify andbound its impact for the first time. We identify a simple method for reducingit -- namely, increasing probability mass on the given answer choices by a)including them in the prompt and b) using in-context learning with even justone example. We show this method eliminates the impact of SFC in the majorityof instances. Our experiments on three diverse datasets and six LMs revealseveral additional surprising findings. For example, both normalization andprompting methods for reducing SFC can be ineffective or even detrimental totask performance for some LMs. We conclude with practical insights foreffectively prompting LMs for multiple-choice tasks.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04782>improving the reliability of large language models by leveraging uncertaintyaware incontext learning</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, large-scale language models (LLMs) have gained attention for their impressive text generation capabilities. However, these models often face the challenge of&quot;hallucination,&quot;which undermines their reliability. In this study, we introduce an uncertainty-aware in-context learning framework to empower the model to enhance or reject its output in response to uncertainty. Human-defined methods for estimating uncertainty typically assume that&quot;uncertainty is lower when the model&#x27;s response is correct compared to when it is incorrect.&quot;However, setting a precise threshold to distinguish correctness is challenging. Therefore, we introduce uncertainty information as an intermediary variable that implicitly influences the model&#x27;s behavior. Our innovative uncertainty-aware in-context learning framework involves fine-tuning the LLM using a calibration dataset. Our aim is to improve the model&#x27;s responses by filtering out answers with high uncertainty while considering the model&#x27;s knowledge limitations. We evaluate the model&#x27;s knowledge by examining multiple responses to the same question for the presence of a correct answer. When the model lacks relevant knowledge, the response should indicate that the question cannot be answered. Conversely, when the model has relevant knowledge, the response should provide the correct answer. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our framework, leading to two key findings. First, the logit output values of the LLM partly reflect inherent uncertainty. Second, our model autonomously recognizes uncertainty, resulting in improved responses.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11392>retrieving supporting evidence for generative question answering</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Current large language models (LLMs) can exhibit near-human levels of performance on many natural language-based tasks, including open-domain question answering. Unfortunately, at this time, they also convincingly hallucinate incorrect answers, so that responses to questions must be verified against external sources before they can be accepted at face value. In this paper, we report two simple experiments to automatically validate generated answers against a corpus. We base our experiments on questions and passages from the MS MARCO (V1) test collection, and a retrieval pipeline consisting of sparse retrieval, dense retrieval and neural rerankers. In the first experiment, we validate the generated answer in its entirety. After presenting a question to an LLM and receiving a generated answer, we query the corpus with the combination of the question + generated answer. We then present the LLM with the combination of the question + generated answer + retrieved answer, prompting it to indicate if the generated answer can be supported by the retrieved answer. In the second experiment, we consider the generated answer at a more granular level, prompting the LLM to extract a list of factual statements from the answer and verifying each statement separately. We query the corpus with each factual statement and then present the LLM with the statement and the corresponding retrieved evidence. The LLM is prompted to indicate if the statement can be supported and make necessary edits using the retrieved material. With an accuracy of over 80%, we find that an LLM is capable of verifying its generated answer when a corpus of supporting material is provided. However, manual assessment of a random sample of questions reveals that incorrect generated answers are missed by this verification process. While this verification process can reduce hallucinations, it can not entirely eliminate them.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16436>neuro symbolic reasoning for planning counterexample guided inductive synthesis using large language models and satisfiability solving</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Generative large language models (LLMs) with instruct training such as GPT-4 can follow human-provided instruction prompts and generate human-like responses to these prompts. Apart from natural language responses, they have also been found to be effective at generating formal artifacts such as code, plans, and logical specifications from natural language prompts. Despite their remarkably improved accuracy, these models are still known to produce factually incorrect or contextually inappropriate results despite their syntactic coherence - a phenomenon often referred to as hallucination. This limitation makes it difficult to use these models to synthesize formal artifacts that are used in safety-critical applications. Unlike tasks such as text summarization and question-answering, bugs in code, plan, and other formal artifacts produced by LLMs can be catastrophic. We posit that we can use the satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers as deductive reasoning engines to analyze the generated solutions from the LLMs, produce counterexamples when the solutions are incorrect, and provide that feedback to the LLMs exploiting the dialog capability of instruct-trained LLMs. This interaction between inductive LLMs and deductive SMT solvers can iteratively steer the LLM to generate the correct response. In our experiments, we use planning over the domain of blocks as our synthesis task for evaluating our approach. We use GPT-4, GPT3.5 Turbo, Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada as the LLMs and Z3 as the SMT solver. Our method allows the user to communicate the planning problem in natural language; even the formulation of queries to SMT solvers is automatically generated from natural language. Thus, the proposed technique can enable non-expert users to describe their problems in natural language, and the combination of LLMs and SMT solvers can produce provably correct solutions.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">35: tasks domain datasets performance range dataset specific benchmark capabilities different evaluation diverse improvement code paper</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09975>fineval a chinese financial domain knowledge evaluation benchmark for large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various natural language processing tasks, yet their efficacy in more challenging and domain-specific tasks remains largely unexplored.

However,manually creating unit tests is a laborious task, motivating the need forautomation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to thisproblem, utilizing additional training or few-shot learning on examples ofexisting tests. This paper presents a large-scale empirical evaluation on theeffectiveness of LLMs for automated unit test generation without additionaltraining or manual effort, providing the LLM with the signature andimplementation of the function under test, along with usage examples extractedfrom documentation. We also attempt to repair failed generated tests byre-prompting the model with the failing test and error message. We implementour approach in TestPilot, a test generation tool for JavaScript thatautomatically generates unit tests for all API functions in an npm package. Weevaluate TestPilot using OpenAI&#x27;s gpt3.5-turbo LLM on 25 npm packages with atotal of 1,684 API functions. The generated tests achieve a median statementcoverage of 70.2% and branch coverage of 52.8%, significantly improving onNessie, a recent feedback-directed JavaScript test generation technique, whichachieves only 51.3% statement coverage and 25.6% branch coverage. We also findthat 92.8% of TestPilot&#x27;s generated tests have no more than 50% similarity withexisting tests (as measured by normalized edit distance), with none of thembeing exact copies.

Overall, weobserved similar results with the former (68.2% median statement coverage), andsomewhat worse results with the latter (54.0% median statement coverage),suggesting that the effectiveness of the approach is influenced by the size andtraining set of the LLM, but does not fundamentally depend on the specificmodel.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16557v1.pdf>effective test generation using pretrained large language models and mutation testing</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  One of the critical phases in software development is software testing.Testing helps with identifying potential bugs and reducing maintenance costs.The goal of automated test generation tools is to ease the development of testsby suggesting efficient bug-revealing tests. Recently, researchers haveleveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) of code to generate unit tests. Whilethe code coverage of generated tests was usually assessed, the literature hasacknowledged that the coverage is weakly correlated with the efficiency oftests in bug detection. To improve over this limitation, in this paper, weintroduce MuTAP for improving the effectiveness of test cases generated by LLMsin terms of revealing bugs by leveraging mutation testing. Our goal is achievedby augmenting prompts with surviving mutants, as those mutants highlight thelimitations of test cases in detecting bugs. MuTAP is capable of generatingeffective test cases in the absence of natural language descriptions of theProgram Under Test (PUTs). We employ different LLMs within MuTAP and evaluatetheir performance on different benchmarks. Our results show that our proposedmethod is able to detect up to 28% more faulty human-written code snippets.Among these, 17% remained undetected by both the current state-of-the-art fullyautomated test generation tool (i.e., Pynguin) and zero-shot/few-shot learningapproaches on LLMs. Furthermore, MuTAP achieves a Mutation Score (MS) of 93.57%on synthetic buggy code, outperforming all other approaches in our evaluation.Our findings suggest that although LLMs can serve as a useful tool to generatetest cases, they require specific post-processing steps to enhance theeffectiveness of the generated test cases which may suffer from syntactic orfunctional errors and may be ineffective in detecting certain types of bugs andtesting corner cases PUTs.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07517>are hard examples also harder to explain a study with human and modelgenerated explanations</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recent work on explainable NLP has shown that few-shot prompting can enable large pre-trained language models (LLMs) to generate grammatical and factual natural language explanations for data labels.

We compare these explanations with those generated by GPT-3 while varying the hardness of the test samples as well as the in-context samples. We observe that (1) GPT-3 explanations are as grammatical as human explanations regardless of the hardness of the test samples, (2) for easy examples, GPT-3 generates highly supportive explanations but human explanations are more generalizable, and (3) for hard examples, human explanations are significantly better than GPT-3 explanations both in terms of label-supportiveness and generalizability judgements. We also find that hardness of the in-context examples impacts the quality of GPT-3 explanations.

Moreover, LLM-generated programs lack guaranteed correctness and require human verification. To address these challenges, we propose ALGO, a framework that synthesizes Algorithmic programs with LLM-Generated Oracles to guide the generation and verify their correctness. ALGO first generates a reference oracle by prompting an LLM to exhaustively enumerate all the combinations of relevant variables. This oracle is then utilized to guide an arbitrary search strategy in exploring the algorithm space and to verify the synthesized algorithms. Our study shows that the LLM-generated oracles are correct for 88% of the cases. With the oracles as verifiers, ALGO can be integrated with any existing code generation model in a model-agnostic manner to enhance its performance. Experiments show that when equipped with ALGO, we achieve an 8x better one-submission pass rate over the Codex model and a 2.6x better one-submission pass rate over CodeT, the current state-of-the-art model on CodeContests. We can also get 1.3x better pass rate over the ChatGPT Code Interpreter on unseen problems.

By embedding asequence of labeled training data and unlabeled test data as a prompt, thisallows for transformers to behave like supervised learning algorithms. Indeed,recent work has shown that when training transformer architectures over randominstances of linear regression problems, these models&#x27; predictions mimic thoseof ordinary least squares.  Towards understanding the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, weinvestigate the dynamics of ICL in transformers with a single linearself-attention layer trained by gradient flow on linear regression tasks. Weshow that despite non-convexity, gradient flow with a suitable randominitialization finds a global minimum of the objective function. At this globalminimum, when given a test prompt of labeled examples from a new predictiontask, the transformer achieves prediction error competitive with the bestlinear predictor over the test prompt distribution. We additionallycharacterize the robustness of the trained transformer to a variety ofdistribution shifts and show that although a number of shifts are tolerated,shifts in the covariate distribution of the prompts are not. Motivated by this,we consider a generalized ICL setting where the covariate distributions canvary across prompts. We show that although gradient flow succeeds at finding aglobal minimum in this setting, the trained transformer is still brittle undermild covariate shifts. We complement this finding with experiments on large,nonlinear transformer architectures which we show are more robust undercovariate shifts.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08391v1.pdf>how many pretraining tasks are needed for incontext learning of linear regression</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Transformers pretrained on diverse tasks exhibit remarkable in-contextlearning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them to solve unseen tasks solely basedon input contexts without adjusting model parameters.

This question is salient given recent successes of passively-trained language models in interactive domains such as tool use. Passive learning is inherently limited. However, we show that purely passive learning can in fact allow an agent to learn generalizable strategies for determining and using causal structures, as long as the agent can intervene at test time. We formally illustrate that learning a strategy of first experimenting, then seeking goals, can allow generalization from passive learning in principle. We then show empirically that agents trained via imitation on expert data can indeed generalize at test time to infer and use causal links which are never present in the training data; these agents can also generalize experimentation strategies to novel variable sets never observed in training. We then show that strategies for causal intervention and exploitation can be generalized from passive data even in a more complex environment with high-dimensional observations, with the support of natural language explanations. Explanations can even allow passive learners to generalize out-of-distribution from perfectly-confounded training data. Finally, we show that language models, trained only on passive next-word prediction, can generalize causal intervention strategies from a few-shot prompt containing examples of experimentation, together with explanations and reasoning. These results highlight the surprising power of passive learning of active causal strategies, and may help to understand the behaviors and capabilities of language models.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15316v1.pdf>training on thin air improve image classification with generated data</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Acquiring high-quality data for training discriminative models is a crucialyet challenging aspect of building effective predictive systems.

This processcurrently relies on at least hundreds of thousands of labeled training samplesfrom mobile clients; yet mobile users often lack willingness or knowledge tolabel their data. Such an inadequacy of data labels is known as a few-shotscenario; it becomes the key blocker for mobile NLP applications.  For the first time, this work investigates federated NLP in the few-shotscenario (FedFSL). By retrofitting algorithmic advances of pseudo labeling andprompt learning, we first establish a training pipeline that deliverscompetitive accuracy when only 0.05% (fewer than 100) of the training data islabeled and the remaining is unlabeled. To instantiate the workflow, we furtherpresent a system FeS, addressing the high execution cost with novel designs.(1) Curriculum pacing, which injects pseudo labels to the training workflow ata rate commensurate to the learning progress; (2) Representational diversity, amechanism for selecting the most learnable data, only for which pseudo labelswill be generated; (3) Co-planning of a model&#x27;s training depth and layercapacity. Together, these designs reduce the training delay, client energy, andnetwork traffic by up to 46.0$\times$, 41.2$\times$ and 3000.0$\times$,respectively. Through algorithm/system co-design, FFNLP demonstrates that FLcan apply to challenging settings where most training samples are unlabeled.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08925>federated large language model a position paper</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large scale language models (LLM) have received significant attention and found diverse applications across various domains, but their development encounters challenges in real-world scenarios. These challenges arise due to the scarcity of public domain data availability and the need to maintain privacy with respect to private domain data. To address these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technology that enables collaborative training of shared models while preserving decentralized data. We propose the concept of federated LLM, which comprises three key components, i.e., federated LLM pre-training, federated LLM fine-tuning, and federated LLM prompt engineering. For each component, we discuss its advantage over traditional LLM training methods and propose specific engineering strategies for implementation. Furthermore, we explore the novel challenges introduced by the integration of FL and LLM. We analyze existing solutions and identify potential obstacles faced by these solutions within the context of federated LLM.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07523>prompting to distill boosting datafree knowledge distillation via reinforced prompt</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) conducts knowledge distillation via eliminating the dependence of original training data, and has recently achieved impressive results in accelerating pre-trained language models. At the heart of DFKD is to reconstruct a synthetic dataset by inverting the parameters of the uncompressed model. Prior DFKD approaches, however, have largely relied on hand-crafted priors of the target data distribution for the reconstruction, which can be inevitably biased and often incompetent to capture the intrinsic distributions. To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based method, termed as PromptDFD, that allows us to take advantage of learned language priors, which effectively harmonizes the synthetic sentences to be semantically and grammatically correct. Specifically, PromptDFD leverages a pre-trained generative model to provide language priors and introduces a reinforced topic prompter to control data synthesis, making the generated samples thematically relevant and semantically plausible, and thus friendly to downstream tasks. As shown in our experiments, the proposed method substantially improves the synthesis quality and achieves considerable improvements on distillation performance. In some cases, PromptDFD even gives rise to results on par with those from the data-driven knowledge distillation with access to the original training data.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">39: data shot learning supervised large training labeled datasets self annotated small number annotation pairs examples</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06133v1.pdf>semanticoriented unlabeled priming for largescale language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Due to the high costs associated with finetuning large language models,various recent works propose to adapt them to specific tasks without anyparameter updates through in-context learning.

The resulting lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the way of conventional supervised learning methods. Instead, we approach this problem using semi-supervised learning with a large language model (LLM). Our pipeline generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our model are limited by ethical considerations, the model’s competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">40: context learning context_learning tasks language ability performance large examples new task perform shown set diverse</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01066v3.pdf>what can transformers learn incontext a case study of simple function classes</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  In-context learning refers to the ability of a model to condition on a promptsequence consisting of in-context examples (input-output pairs corresponding tosome task) along with a new query input, and generate the corresponding output.Crucially, in-context learning happens only at inference time without anyparameter updates to the model. While large language models such as GPT-3exhibit some ability to perform in-context learning, it is unclear what therelationship is between tasks on which this succeeds and what is present in thetraining data. To make progress towards understanding in-context learning, weconsider the well-defined problem of training a model to in-context learn afunction class (e.g., linear functions): that is, given data derived from somefunctions in the class, can we train a model to in-context learn &quot;most&quot;functions from this class? We show empirically that standard Transformers canbe trained from scratch to perform in-context learning of linear functions --that is, the trained model is able to learn unseen linear functions fromin-context examples with performance comparable to the optimal least squaresestimator. In fact, in-context learning is possible even under two forms ofdistribution shift: (i) between the training data of the model andinference-time prompts, and (ii) between the in-context examples and the queryinput during inference. We also show that we can train Transformers toin-context learn more complex function classes -- namely sparse linearfunctions, two-layer neural networks, and decision trees -- with performancethat matches or exceeds task-specific learning algorithms.

We coin this phenomenonmeta-in-context learning. Looking at two idealized domains, a one-dimensionalregression task and a two-armed bandit task, we show that meta-in-contextlearning adaptively reshapes a large language model&#x27;s priors over expectedtasks.

The LM learnsfrom these examples without being explicitly pretrained to learn. Thus, it isunclear what enables in-context learning. In this paper, we study howin-context learning can emerge when pretraining documents have long-rangecoherence. Here, the LM must infer a latent document-level concept to generatecoherent next tokens during pretraining. At test time, in-context learningoccurs when the LM also infers a shared latent concept between examples in aprompt. We prove when this occurs despite a distribution mismatch betweenprompts and pretraining data in a setting where the pretraining distribution isa mixture of HMMs. In contrast to messy large-scale datasets used to train LMscapable of in-context learning, we generate a small-scale synthetic dataset(GINC) where Transformers and LSTMs both exhibit in-context learning. Beyondthe theory, experiments on GINC exhibit large-scale real-world phenomenaincluding improved in-context performance with model scaling (despite the samepretraining loss), sensitivity to example order, and instances where zero-shotis better than few-shot in-context learning.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">41: medical clinical health healthcare evaluation mental patient gpt-4 patients mental_health information diagnosis use report notes</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17384v1.pdf>summqa at mediqachat 2023incontext learning with gpt4 for medical summarization</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Medical dialogue summarization is challenging due to the unstructured natureof medical conversations, the use of medical terminology in gold summaries, andthe need to identify key information across multiple symptom sets.

Materials and Methods Two approaches were evaluated to reduce clinical note labeling overhead for creating a training set for a classifier: one using programmatic codes, and the other using prompts to large language models (LLMs). Probabilistically labeled notes were then used to fine-tune a classifier, which identified patients with AF pre-diagnosis mentions in a note. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, where the baseline characteristics and subsequent care patterns of patients identified by the classifier were compared against those who did not receive pre-diagnosis. Results Label model derived from prompt-based labeling heuristics using LLMs (precision = 0.67, recall = 0.83, F1 = 0.74) nearly achieved the performance of code-based heuristics (precision = 0.84, recall = 0.72, F1 = 0.77), while cutting down the cost to create a labeled training set. The classifier learned on the labeled notes accurately identified patients with AF pre-diagnosis (precision = 0.85, recall = 0.81, F1 = 0.83). Those patients who received pre-diagnosis exhibited different demographic and comorbidity characteristics, and were enriched for anticoagulation and eventual diagnosis of AF. At the index diagnosis, existence of pre-diagnosis did not stratify patients on clinical characteristics, but did correlate with anticoagulant prescription. Discussion and Conclusion Our work establishes the feasibility of an EHR-based surveillance system for wearable devices that render AF pre-diagnosis. Further work is necessary to generalize these findings for patient populations at other sites.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13035>spec a soft promptbased calibration on mitigating performance variability in clinical notes summarization</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Electronic health records (EHRs) store an extensive array of patient information, encompassing medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, and test outcomes. These records are crucial for enabling healthcare providers to make well-informed decisions regarding patient care. Summarizing clinical notes further assists healthcare professionals in pinpointing potential health risks and making better-informed decisions. This process contributes to reducing errors and enhancing patient outcomes by ensuring providers have access to the most pertinent and current patient data. Recent research has shown that incorporating prompts with large language models (LLMs) substantially boosts the efﬁcacy of summarization tasks. However, we show that this approach also leads to increased output variance, resulting in notably divergent outputs even when prompts share similar meanings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a model-agnostic Soft Prompt-Based Calibration (SPeC) pipeline that employs soft prompts to diminish variance while preserving the advantages of prompt-based summarization. Experimental ﬁndings on multiple clinical note tasks and LLMs indicate that our method not only bolsters performance but also effectively curbs variance for various LLMs, providing a more uniform and dependable solution for summarizing vital medical information.</p></details><li><a href=https://www.mdpi.com/2036-7503/15/3/50/pdf?version=1695182872>early diagnostic markers of lateonset neonatal sepsis</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Objective: Early diagnosis of nosocomial infections in newborns is a great challenge, because in the initial phase of systemic infection, clinical symptoms are often non-specific, and routinely used hematological markers are not sufficiently informative.

Material and methods: A prospective clinical–epidemiological study was conducted in a third-level NICU in Pleven, Bulgaria. Patients with suspected late-onset sepsis and healthy controls were tested. A sandwich ELISA method was used to measure the serum concentrations of biomarkers. Results: Sixty newborns were included, of which 35% symptomatic and infected, 33.3% symptomatic but uninfected and 31.7% asymptomatic controls. The mean values of PCT, IL-6, I/T index and PLT differ significantly in the three groups. For ESM-1, IL-8 and CRP, the difference was statistically insignificant. The best sensitivity (78%) and negative predictive value (84%) was found for IL-6. The combinations of PCT + IL-6 and PCT + IL-6+ I/T+ PLT showed very good diagnostic potential.

Here we explore the performance of prompt-based learning for simultaneously controlling the personality and the semantic accuracy of an NLG for task-oriented dialogue. We experiment with prompt-based learning on the PERSONAGE restaurant recommendation corpus to generate semantically and stylistically-controlled text for 5 different Big-5 personality types: agreeable, disagreeable, conscientious, unconscientious, and extravert. We test two different classes of discrete prompts to generate utterances for a particular personality style: (1) prompts that demonstrate generating directly from a meaning representation that includes a personality specification; and (2) prompts that rely on first converting the meaning representation to a textual pseudo-reference, and then using the pseudo-reference in a textual style transfer (TST) prompt. In each case, we show that we can vastly improve performance by over-generating outputs and ranking them, testing several ranking functions based on automatic metrics for semantic accuracy, personality-match, and fluency. We also test whether NLG personality demonstrations from the restaurant domain can be used with meaning representations for the video game domain to generate personality stylized utterances about video games. Our findings show that the TST prompts produces the highest semantic accuracy (78.46% for restaurants and 87.6% for video games) and personality accuracy (100% for restaurants and 97% for video games). Our results on transferring personality style to video game utterances are surprisingly good. To our knowledge, there is no previous work testing the application of prompt-based learning to simultaneously controlling both style and semantic accuracy in NLG.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10168v1.pdf>fewshot adaptation for parsing contextual utterances with llms</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  We evaluate the ability of semantic parsers based on large language models(LLMs) to handle contextual utterances.

In this paper, we present a novel perspective for solving knowledge-intensive tasks by replacing document retrievers with large language model generators. We call our method generate-then-read (GenRead), which first prompts a large language model to generate contextutal documents based on a given question, and then reads the generated documents to produce the final answer. Furthermore, we propose a novel clustering-based prompting method that selects distinct prompts, resulting in the generated documents that cover different perspectives, leading to better recall over acceptable answers. We conduct extensive experiments on three different knowledge-intensive tasks, including open-domain QA, fact checking, and dialogue system. Notably, GenRead achieves 71.6 and 54.4 exact match scores on TriviaQA and WebQ, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieve-then-read pipeline DPR-FiD by +4.0 and +3.9, without retrieving any documents from any external knowledge source. Lastly, we demonstrate the model performance can be further improved by combining retrieval and generation.

To systematically study therobustness of Table QA models, we propose a benchmark called RobuT, whichbuilds upon existing Table QA datasets (WTQ, WikiSQL-Weak, and SQA) andincludes human-annotated adversarial perturbations in terms of table header,table content, and question. Our results indicate that both state-of-the-artTable QA models and large language models (e.g., GPT-3) with few-shot learningfalter in these adversarial sets. We propose to address this problem by usinglarge language models to generate adversarial examples to enhance training,which significantly improves the robustness of Table QA models.

The flavor of retrieval typically used in classical applications can be termed as homogeneous and relaxed, where queries and corpus elements are both natural language (NL) utterances (homogeneous) and the goal is to pick most relevant elements from the corpus in the Top-K, where K is large, such as 10, 25, 50 or even 100 (relaxed). Recently, retrieval is being used extensively in preparing prompts for large language models (LLMs) to enable LLMs to perform targeted tasks. These new applications of retrieval are often heterogeneous and strict -- the queries and the corpus contain different kinds of entities, such as NL and code, and there is a need for improving retrieval at Top-K for small values of K, such as K=1 or 3 or 5. Current dense retrieval techniques based on pretrained embeddings provide a general-purpose and powerful approach for retrieval, but they are oblivious to task-specific notions of similarity of heterogeneous artifacts. We introduce Adapted Dense Retrieval, a mechanism to transform embeddings to enable improved task-specific, heterogeneous and strict retrieval. Adapted Dense Retrieval works by learning a low-rank residual adaptation of the pretrained black-box embedding. We empirically validate our approach by showing improvements over the state-of-the-art general-purpose embeddings-based baseline.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10509>interleaving retrieval with chainofthought reasoning for knowledgeintensive multistep questions</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Prompting-based large language models (LLMs) are surprisingly powerful at generating natural language reasoning steps or Chains-of-Thoughts (CoT) for multi-step question answering (QA). They struggle, however, when the necessary knowledge is either unavailable to the LLM or not up-to-date within its parameters. While using the question to retrieve relevant text from an external knowledge source helps LLMs, we observe that this one-step retrieve-and-read approach is insufficient for multi-step QA. Here, what to retrieve depends on what has already been derived, which in turn may depend on what was previously retrieved. To address this, we propose IRCoT, a new approach for multi-step QA that interleaves retrieval with steps (sentences) in a CoT, guiding the retrieval with CoT and in turn using retrieved results to improve CoT. Using IRCoT with GPT3 substantially improves retrieval (up to 21 points) as well as downstream QA (up to 15 points) on four datasets: HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, and IIRC. We observe similar substantial gains in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings as well as with much smaller models such as Flan-T5-large without additional training. IRCoT reduces model hallucination, resulting in factually more accurate CoT reasoning.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">44: problems problem solving solutions solution math mathematical solve questions word physics program form approaches university</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08267v1.pdf>solving probability and statistics problems by program synthesis</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  We solve university level probability and statistics questions by programsynthesis using OpenAI&#x27;s Codex, a Transformer trained on text and fine-tuned oncode.

However, existing prompting approaches cannot reuse insights of solving similar problems and suffer from accumulated errors in multi-step reasoning, since they prompt LLMs to reason \textit{from scratch}. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{\textit{Thought Propagation} (TP)}, which explores the analogous problems and leverages their solutions to enhance the complex reasoning ability of LLMs. These analogous problems are related to the input one, with reusable solutions and problem-solving strategies. Thus, it is promising to propagate insights of solving previous analogous problems to inspire new problem-solving. To achieve this, TP first prompts LLMs to propose and solve a set of analogous problems that are related to the input one. Then, TP reuses the results of analogous problems to directly yield a new solution or derive a knowledge-intensive plan for execution to amend the initial solution obtained from scratch. TP is compatible with existing prompting approaches, allowing plug-and-play generalization and enhancement in a wide range of tasks without much labor in task-specific prompt engineering. Experiments across three challenging tasks demonstrate TP enjoys a substantial improvement over the baselines by an average of 12\% absolute increase in finding the optimal solutions in Shortest-path Reasoning, 13\% improvement of human preference in Creative Writing, and 15\% enhancement in the task completion rate of LLM-Agent Planning.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">45: based propose method methods results approach proposed novel experiments text demonstrate existing outperforms effective problem</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07126v1.pdf>instanceaware prompt learning for language understanding and generation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Recently, prompt learning has become a new paradigm to utilize pre-trainedlanguage models (PLMs) and achieves promising results in downstream tasks witha negligible increase of parameters. The current usage of discrete andcontinuous prompts assumes that the prompt is fixed for a specific task and allsamples in the task share the same prompt. However, a task may contain quitediverse samples in which some are easy and others are difficult, and diverseprompts are desirable. In this paper, we propose an instance-aware promptlearning method that learns a different prompt for each instance. Specifically,we suppose that each learnable prompt token has a different contribution todifferent instances, and we learn the contribution by calculating the relevancescore between an instance and each prompt token. The contribution weightedprompt would be instance aware. We apply our method to both unidirectional andbidirectional PLMs on both language understanding and generation tasks.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method obtains considerableimprovements compared to strong baselines.

However, existing studies in this area rely heavily on large-scale supervised data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect. Thus, there is a need to address the challenge of few-shot multimodal sentiment analysis. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method called Multimodal Probabilistic Fusion Prompts (MultiPoint) that leverages diverse cues from different modalities for multimodal sentiment detection in the few-shot scenario. Specifically, we start by introducing a Consistently Distributed Sampling approach called CDS, which ensures that the few-shot dataset has the same category distribution as the full dataset. Unlike previous approaches primarily using prompts based on the text modality, we design unified multimodal prompts to reduce discrepancies between different modalities and dynamically incorporate multimodal demonstrations into the context of each multimodal instance. To enhance the model&#x27;s robustness, we introduce a probabilistic fusion method to fuse output predictions from multiple diverse prompts for each input. Our extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. First, our method outperforms strong baselines in the multimodal few-shot setting. Furthermore, under the same amount of data (1% of the full dataset), our CDS-based experimental results significantly outperform those based on previously sampled datasets constructed from the same number of instances of each class.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13214v1.pdf>fewshot stance detection via targetaware prompt distillation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Stance detection aims to identify whether the author of a text is in favorof, against, or neutral to a given target. The main challenge of this taskcomes two-fold: few-shot learning resulting from the varying targets and thelack of contextual information of the targets. Existing works mainly focus onsolving the second issue by designing attention-based models or introducingnoisy external knowledge, while the first issue remains under-explored. In thispaper, inspired by the potential capability of pre-trained language models(PLMs) serving as knowledge bases and few-shot learners, we propose tointroduce prompt-based fine-tuning for stance detection. PLMs can provideessential contextual information for the targets and enable few-shot learningvia prompts. Considering the crucial role of the target in stance detectiontask, we design target-aware prompts and propose a novel verbalizer. Instead ofmapping each label to a concrete word, our verbalizer maps each label to avector and picks the label that best captures the correlation between thestance and the target. Moreover, to alleviate the possible defect of dealingwith varying targets with a single hand-crafted prompt, we propose to distillthe information learned from multiple prompts. Experimental results show thesuperior performance of our proposed model in both full-data and few-shotscenarios.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14301v2.pdf>psg promptbased sequence generation for acronym extraction</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Acronym extraction aims to find acronyms (i.e., short-forms) and theirmeanings (i.e., long-forms) from the documents, which is important forscientific document understanding (SDU@AAAI-22) tasks.

The core idea of prompt-tuning is to insert text pieces (i.e., templates) into the input and transform a classification task into a masked language modeling problem. However, for relation extraction, determining an appropriate prompt template requires domain expertise, and it is cumbersome and time-consuming to obtain a suitable label word. Furthermore, there exists abundant semantic and prior knowledge among the relation labels that cannot be ignored. To this end, we focus on incorporating knowledge among relation labels into prompt-tuning for relation extraction and propose a Knowledge-aware Prompt-tuning approach with synergistic optimization (KnowPrompt). Specifically, we inject latent knowledge contained in relation labels into prompt construction with learnable virtual type words and answer words. Then, we synergistically optimize their representation with structured constraints. Extensive experimental results on five datasets with standard and low-resource settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and datasets are available in GitHub1 for reproducibility.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">46: vision clip learning features multimodal contrastive class pre visual semantic downstream modality representations classification embeddings</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3581783.3613819>better integrating vision and semantics for improving fewshot classification</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Some recent methods address few-shot classification by integrating visual and semantic prototypes. However, they usually ignore the difference in feature structure between the visual and semantic modalities, which leads to limited performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called bimodal integrator (BMI), to better integrate visual and semantic prototypes. In BMI, we first construct a latent space for each modality via a variational autoencoder, and then align the semantic latent space to the visual latent space. Through this semantics-to-vision alignment, the semantic modality is mapped to the visual latent space and has the same feature structure as the visual modality. As a result, the visual and semantic prototypes can be better integrated. In addition, based on the multivariate Gaussian distribution and the prompt engineering, a data augmentation scheme is designed to ensure the accuracy of modality alignment during the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that BMI significantly improves few-shot classification, making simple baselines outperform the most advanced methods on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06221>multiprompt with depth partitioned crossmodal learning</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, soft prompt learning methods have been proposed to fine-tune large-scale vision-language pre-trained models for various downstream tasks. These methods typically combine learnable textual tokens with class tokens as input for models with frozen parameters. However, they often employ a single prompt to describe class contexts, failing to capture categories&#x27; diverse attributes adequately. This study introduces the Partitioned Multi-modal Prompt (PMPO), a multi-modal prompting technique that extends the soft prompt from a single learnable prompt to multiple prompts. Our method divides the visual encoder depths and connects learnable prompts to the separated visual depths, enabling different prompts to capture the hierarchical contextual depths of visual representations. Furthermore, to maximize the advantages of multi-prompt learning, we incorporate prior information from manually designed templates and learnable multi-prompts, thus improving the generalization capabilities of our approach. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three challenging tasks: new class generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization. For instance, our method achieves a $79.28$ harmonic mean, averaged over 11 diverse image recognition datasets ($+7.62$ compared to CoOp), demonstrating significant competitiveness compared to state-of-the-art prompting methods.</p></details><li><a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3581783.3611805>multimodal prompt transformer with hybrid contrastive learning for emotion recognition in conversation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) plays an important role in driving the development of human-machine interaction. Emotions can exist in multiple modalities, and multimodal ERC mainly faces two problems: (1) the noise problem in the cross-modal information fusion process, and (2) the prediction problem of less sample emotion labels that are semantically similar but different categories. To address these issues and fully utilize the features of each modality, we adopted the following strategies: first, deep emotion cues extraction was performed on modalities with strong representation ability, and feature filters were designed as multimodal prompt information for modalities with weak representation ability. Then, we designed a Multimodal Prompt Transformer (MPT) to perform cross-modal information fusion. MPT embeds multimodal fusion information into each attention layer of the Transformer, allowing prompt information to participate in encoding textual features and being fused with multi-level textual information to obtain better multimodal fusion features. Finally, we used the Hybrid Contrastive Learning (HCL) strategy to optimize the model&#x27;s ability to handle labels with few samples. This strategy uses unsupervised contrastive learning to improve the representation ability of multimodal fusion and supervised contrastive learning to mine the information of labels with few samples.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) has also shown promise in improving visual recognition by learning invariant features. However, the combination of CLIP with SSL is found to face challenges due to the multi-task framework that blends CLIP&#x27;s contrastive loss and SSL&#x27;s loss, including difficulties with loss weighting and inconsistency among different views of images in CLIP&#x27;s output space. To overcome these challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based model called GOPro, which is a unified framework that ensures similarity between various augmented views of input images in a shared image-text embedding space, using a pair of learnable image and text projectors atop CLIP, to promote invariance and generalizability. To automatically learn such prompts, we leverage the visual content and style primitives extracted from pre-trained CLIP and adapt them to the target task. In addition to CLIP&#x27;s cross-domain contrastive loss, we introduce a visual contrastive loss and a novel prompt consistency loss, considering the different views of the images. GOPro is trained end-to-end on all three loss objectives, combining the strengths of CLIP and SSL in a principled manner. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GOPro outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting techniques on three challenging domain generalization tasks across multiple benchmarks by a significant margin.

Recently, instructional prompts have shown significant improvement towards multi-task generalization; however, the effect of instructional prompts and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has not been systematically studied in the biomedical domain. Motivated by this, this paper explores the impact of instructional prompts for biomedical MTL. We introduce the BoX, a collection of 32 instruction tasks for Biomedical NLP across (X) various categories. Using this meta-dataset, we propose a unified model termed In-BoXBART, that can jointly learn all tasks of the BoX without any task-specific modules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a unified model in the biomedical domain and use instructions to achieve generalization across several biomedical tasks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model: 1) outperforms the single-task baseline by ~3% and multi-task (without instruction) baseline by ~18% on an average, and 2) shows ~23% improvement compared to the single-task baseline in few-shot learning (i.e., 32 instances per task) on an average. Our analysis indicates that there is significant room for improvement across tasks in the BoX, implying the scope for future research direction.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02842>sweeping heterogeneity with smart mops mixture of prompts for llm task adaptation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to solve a variety of tasks, such as text summarization and mathematical questions, just out of the box, but they are often trained with a single task in mind. Due to high computational costs, the current trend is to use prompt instruction tuning to better adjust monolithic, pretrained LLMs for new -- but often individual -- downstream tasks. Thus, how one would expand prompt tuning to handle -- concomitantly -- heterogeneous tasks and data distributions is a widely open question. To address this gap, we suggest the use of \emph{Mixture of Prompts}, or MoPs, associated with smart gating functionality: the latter -- whose design is one of the contributions of this paper -- can identify relevant skills embedded in different groups of prompts and dynamically assign combined experts (i.e., collection of prompts), based on the target task. Additionally, MoPs are empirically agnostic to any model compression technique applied -- for efficiency reasons -- as well as instruction data source and task composition. In practice, MoPs can simultaneously mitigate prompt training&quot;interference&quot;in multi-task, multi-source scenarios (e.g., task and data heterogeneity across sources), as well as possible implications from model approximations. As a highlight, MoPs manage to decrease final perplexity from $\sim20\%$ up to $\sim70\%$, as compared to baselines, in the federated scenario, and from $\sim 3\%$ up to $\sim30\%$ in the centralized scenario.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02406>decomposed prompting a modular approach for solving complex tasks</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Few-shot prompting is a surprisingly powerful way to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve various tasks. However, this approach struggles as the task complexity increases or when the individual reasoning steps of the task themselves are hard to learn, especially when embedded in more complex tasks. To address this, we propose Decomposed Prompting, a new approach to solve complex tasks by decomposing them (via prompting) into simpler sub-tasks that can be delegated to a library of prompting-based LLMs dedicated to these sub-tasks. This modular structure allows each prompt to be optimized for its specific sub-task, further decomposed if necessary, and even easily replaced with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired. We show that the flexibility and modularity of Decomposed Prompting allows it to outperform prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3. On symbolic reasoning tasks, we can further decompose sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs into even simpler solvable sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input length, we can recursively decompose the task into the same task but with smaller inputs. We also evaluate our approach on textual multi-step reasoning tasks: on long-context multi-hop QA task, we can more effectively teach the sub-tasks via our separate sub-tasks prompts; and on open-domain multi-hop QA, we can incorporate a symbolic information retrieval within our decomposition framework, leading to improved performance on both tasks.

To address these issues, in this paper, wepropose \textbf{JiuZhang~2.0}, a unified Chinese PLM specially for multi-taskmathematical problem solving. Our idea is to maintain a moderate-sized modeland employ the \emph{cross-task knowledge sharing} to improve the modelcapacity in a multi-task setting. Specially, we construct aMixture-of-Experts~(MoE) architecture for modeling mathematical text, so as tocapture the common mathematical knowledge across tasks. For optimizing the MoEarchitecture, we design \emph{multi-task continual pre-training} and\emph{multi-task fine-tuning} strategies for multi-task adaptation. Thesetraining strategies can effectively decompose the knowledge from the task dataand establish the cross-task sharing via expert networks. In order to furtherimprove the general capacity of solving different complex tasks, we leveragelarge language models~(LLMs) as complementary models to iteratively refine thegenerated solution by our PLM, via in-context learning. Extensive experimentshave demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10819v2.pdf>evaluating the instructionfollowing robustness of large language models to prompt injection</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in followinginstructions, making them valuable in customer-facing applications. However,their impressive capabilities also raise concerns about the amplification ofrisks posed by adversarial instructions, which can be injected into the modelinput by third-party attackers to manipulate LLMs&#x27; original instructions andprompt unintended actions and content. Therefore, it is crucial to understandLLMs&#x27; ability to accurately discern which instructions to follow to ensuretheir safe deployment in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose apioneering benchmark for automatically evaluating the robustness ofinstruction-following LLMs against adversarial instructions injected in theprompt. The objective of this benchmark is to quantify the extent to which LLMsare influenced by injected adversarial instructions and assess their ability todifferentiate between these injected adversarial instructions and original userinstructions. Through experiments conducted with state-of-the-artinstruction-following LLMs, we uncover significant limitations in theirrobustness against adversarial instruction injection attacks. Furthermore, ourfindings indicate that prevalent instruction-tuned models are prone to being``overfitted&#x27;&#x27; to follow any instruction phrase in the prompt without trulyunderstanding which instructions should be followed. This highlights the needto address the challenge of training models to comprehend prompts instead ofmerely following instruction phrases and completing the text.

We are interested in this question because if LLMs were able toimprove each other, it would imply the possibility of creating strong AI agentswith minimal human intervention. We ask two LLMs to negotiate with each other,playing the roles of a buyer and a seller, respectively. They aim to reach adeal with the buyer targeting a lower price and the seller a higher one. Athird language model, playing the critic, provides feedback to a player toimprove the player&#x27;s negotiation strategies. We let the two agents playmultiple rounds, using previous negotiation history and AI feedback asin-context demonstrations to improve the model&#x27;s negotiation strategyiteratively. We use different LLMs (GPT and Claude) for different roles and usethe deal price as the evaluation metric. Our experiments reveal multipleintriguing findings: (1) Only a subset of the language models we consider canself-play and improve the deal price from AI feedback, weaker models either donot understand the game&#x27;s rules or cannot incorporate AI feedback for furtherimprovement. (2) Models&#x27; abilities to learn from the feedback differ whenplaying different roles. For example, it is harder for Claude-instant toimprove as the buyer than as the seller. (3) When unrolling the game tomultiple rounds, stronger agents can consistently improve their performance bymeaningfully using previous experiences and iterative AI feedback, yet have ahigher risk of breaking the deal.

The objective of this competition is for participants to create effective prompts for ChatGPT--enabling it to generate Science Birds levels with high stability and character-like qualities--fully using their creativity as well as prompt engineering skills. ChatGPT is a conversational agent developed by OpenAI. Science Birds is selected as the competition platform because designing an Angry Birds-like level is not a trivial task due to the in-game gravity; the quality of the levels is determined by their stability. To lower the entry barrier to the competition, we limit the task to the generation of capitalized English alphabetical characters. We also allow only a single prompt to be used for generating all the characters. Here, the quality of the generated levels is determined by their stability and similarity to the given characters. A sample prompt is provided to participants for their reference. An experiment is conducted to determine the effectiveness of several modified versions of this sample prompt on level stability and similarity by testing them on several characters. To the best of our knowledge, we believe that ChatGPT4PCG is the first competition of its kind and hope to inspire enthusiasm for prompt engineering in procedural content generation.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14422v1.pdf>large language models are biased to overestimate profoundness</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Recent advancements in natural language processing by large language models(LLMs), such as GPT-4, have been suggested to approach Artificial GeneralIntelligence. And yet, it is still under dispute whether LLMs possess similarreasoning abilities to humans. This study evaluates GPT-4 and various otherLLMs in judging the profoundness of mundane, motivational, and pseudo-profoundstatements. We found a significant statement-to-statement correlation betweenthe LLMs and humans, irrespective of the type of statements and the promptingtechnique used. However, LLMs systematically overestimate the profoundness ofnonsensical statements, with the exception of Tk-instruct, which uniquelyunderestimates the profoundness of statements. Only few-shot learning prompts,as opposed to chain-of-thought prompting, draw LLMs ratings closer to humans.Furthermore, this work provides insights into the potential biases induced byReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), inducing an increase in thebias to overestimate the profoundness of statements.</p></details></ul></details></div>
