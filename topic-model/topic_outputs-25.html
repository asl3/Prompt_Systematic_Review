While LLMs have advanced the state-of-the-art on these tasks withstructure implications, whether LLMs could explicitly process textualdescriptions of graphs and structures, map them to grounded conceptual spaces,and perform structured operations remains underexplored. To this end, wepropose NLGraph (Natural Language Graph), a comprehensive benchmark ofgraph-based problem solving designed in natural language. NLGraph contains29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexityfrom simple tasks such as connectivity and shortest path up to complex problemssuch as maximum flow and simulating graph neural networks. We evaluate LLMs(GPT-3/4) with various prompting approaches on the NLGraph benchmark and findthat 1) language models do demonstrate preliminary graph reasoning abilities,2) the benefit of advanced prompting and in-context learning diminishes on morecomplex graph problems, while 3) LLMs are also (un)surprisingly brittle in theface of spurious correlations in graph and problem settings. We then proposeBuild-a-Graph Prompting and Algorithmic Prompting, two instruction-basedapproaches to enhance LLMs in solving natural language graph problems.Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting improve the performance of LLMs onNLGraph by 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks and settings, while how tosolve the most complicated graph reasoning tasks in our setup with languagemodels remains an open research question. The NLGraph benchmark and evaluationcode are available at https://github.com/Arthur-Heng/NLGraph.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11206>retrieverewriteanswer a kgtotext enhanced llms framework for knowledge graph question answering</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Despite their competitive performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, large language models (LLMs) still have limitations in memorizing all world knowledge especially long tail knowledge. In this paper, we study the KG-augmented language model approach for solving the knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) task that requires rich world knowledge. Existing work has shown that retrieving KG knowledge to enhance LLMs prompting can significantly improve LLMs performance in KGQA. However, their approaches lack a well-formed verbalization of KG knowledge, i.e., they ignore the gap between KG representations and textual representations. To this end, we propose an answer-sensitive KG-to-Text approach that can transform KG knowledge into well-textualized statements most informative for KGQA. Based on this approach, we propose a KG-to-Text enhanced LLMs framework for solving the KGQA task. Experiments on several KGQA benchmarks show that the proposed KG-to-Text augmented LLMs approach outperforms previous KG-augmented LLMs approaches regarding answer accuracy and usefulness of knowledge statements.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02406>decomposed prompting a modular approach for solving complex tasks</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Few-shot prompting is a surprisingly powerful way to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve various tasks. However, this approach struggles as the task complexity increases or when the individual reasoning steps of the task themselves are hard to learn, especially when embedded in more complex tasks. To address this, we propose Decomposed Prompting, a new approach to solve complex tasks by decomposing them (via prompting) into simpler sub-tasks that can be delegated to a library of prompting-based LLMs dedicated to these sub-tasks. This modular structure allows each prompt to be optimized for its specific sub-task, further decomposed if necessary, and even easily replaced with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired. We show that the flexibility and modularity of Decomposed Prompting allows it to outperform prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3. On symbolic reasoning tasks, we can further decompose sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs into even simpler solvable sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input length, we can recursively decompose the task into the same task but with smaller inputs. We also evaluate our approach on textual multi-step reasoning tasks: on long-context multi-hop QA task, we can more effectively teach the sub-tasks via our separate sub-tasks prompts; and on open-domain multi-hop QA, we can incorporate a symbolic information retrieval within our decomposition framework, leading to improved performance on both tasks.

In real-world situations, problems often span a spectrum of complexities. Humans inherently adjust their problem-solving approaches based on task complexity. However, most methodologies that leverage LLMs tend to adopt a uniform approach: utilizing consistent models, prompting methods, and degrees of problem decomposition, regardless of the problem complexity. Inflexibility of them can bring unnecessary computational overhead or sub-optimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce an Adaptive-Solver framework. It strategically modulates solving strategies based on the difficulties of the problems. Given an initial solution, the framework functions with two primary modules. The initial evaluation module assesses the adequacy of the current solution. If improvements are needed, the subsequent adaptation module comes into play. Within this module, three key adaptation strategies are employed: (1) Model Adaptation: Switching to a stronger LLM when a weaker variant is inadequate. (2) Prompting Method Adaptation: Alternating between different prompting techniques to suit the problem&#x27;s nuances. (3) Decomposition Granularity Adaptation: Breaking down a complex problem into more fine-grained sub-questions to enhance solvability. Through such dynamic adaptations, our framework not only enhances computational efficiency but also elevates the overall performance. This dual-benefit ensures both the efficiency of the system for simpler tasks and the precision required for more complex questions. Experimental results from complex reasoning tasks reveal that the prompting method adaptation and decomposition granularity adaptation enhance performance across all tasks. Furthermore, the model adaptation approach significantly reduces API costs (up to 50%) while maintaining superior performance.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11027v1.pdf>jiuzhang 20 a unified chinese pretrained language model for multitask mathematical problem solving</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Although pre-trained language models~(PLMs) have recently advanced theresearch progress in mathematical reasoning, they are not specially designed asa capable multi-task solver, suffering from high cost for multi-task deployment(\eg a model copy for a task) and inferior performance on complex mathematicalproblems in practical applications. To address these issues, in this paper, wepropose \textbf{JiuZhang~2.0}, a unified Chinese PLM specially for multi-taskmathematical problem solving. Our idea is to maintain a moderate-sized modeland employ the \emph{cross-task knowledge sharing} to improve the modelcapacity in a multi-task setting. Specially, we construct aMixture-of-Experts~(MoE) architecture for modeling mathematical text, so as tocapture the common mathematical knowledge across tasks. For optimizing the MoEarchitecture, we design \emph{multi-task continual pre-training} and\emph{multi-task fine-tuning} strategies for multi-task adaptation. Thesetraining strategies can effectively decompose the knowledge from the task dataand establish the cross-task sharing via expert networks. In order to furtherimprove the general capacity of solving different complex tasks, we leveragelarge language models~(LLMs) as complementary models to iteratively refine thegenerated solution by our PLM, via in-context learning. Extensive experimentshave demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">1: text generation image generated sql style diffusion images high art content quality generate generative generating</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03917>noise2music textconditioned music generation with diffusion models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce Noise2Music, where a series of diffusion models is trained to generate high-quality 30-second music clips from text prompts. Two types of diffusion models, a generator model, which generates an intermediate representation conditioned on text, and a cascader model, which generates high-fidelity audio conditioned on the intermediate representation and possibly the text, are trained and utilized in succession to generate high-fidelity music. We explore two options for the intermediate representation, one using a spectrogram and the other using audio with lower fidelity. We find that the generated audio is not only able to faithfully reflect key elements of the text prompt such as genre, tempo, instruments, mood, and era, but goes beyond to ground fine-grained semantics of the prompt. Pretrained large language models play a key role in this story -- they are used to generate paired text for the audio of the training set and to extract embeddings of the text prompts ingested by the diffusion models.

However, current models still face misalignment issues (e.g.,problematic spatial relation understanding and numeration failure) in complexnatural scenes, which impedes the high-faithfulness text-to-image generation.Although recent efforts have been made to improve controllability by givingfine-grained guidance (e.g., sketch and scribbles), this issue has not beenfundamentally tackled since users have to provide such guidance informationmanually. In this work, we strive to synthesize high-fidelity images that aresemantically aligned with a given textual prompt without any guidance. Towardthis end, we propose a coarse-to-fine paradigm to achieve layout planning andimage generation. Concretely, we first generate the coarse-grained layoutconditioned on a given textual prompt via in-context learning based on LargeLanguage Models. Afterward, we propose a fine-grained object-interactiondiffusion method to synthesize high-faithfulness images conditioned on theprompt and the automatically generated layout. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models interms of layout and image generation.

However, the quality of the prompts depends on the demonstrations given to the models, and creating many of them by hand is costly. We introduce Synthetic prompting, a method that leverages a few handcrafted examples to prompt the model to generate more examples by itself, and selects effective demonstrations to elicit better reasoning. Our method alternates between a backward and forward process to generate new examples. The backward process generates a question that match a sampled reasoning chain, so that the question is solvable and clear. The forward process produces a more detailed reasoning chain for the question, improving the quality of the example. We evaluate our method on numerical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks, and show that it outperforms existing prompting techniques.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04091>planandsolve prompting improving zeroshot chainofthought reasoning by large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been shown to deliver impressive performance in various NLP tasks. To tackle multi-step reasoning tasks, Few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting includes a few manually crafted step-by-step reasoning demonstrations which enable LLMs to explicitly generate reasoning steps and improve their reasoning task accuracy. To eliminate the manual efforts, Zero-shot-CoT concatenates the target problem statement with “Let’s think step by step” as an input prompt to LLMs. Despite the success of Zero-shot-CoT, it still suffers from three pitfalls: calculation errors, missing-step errors, and semantic misunderstanding errors. To address the missing-step errors, we propose Plan-and-Solve (PS) Prompting. It consists of two components: first, devising a plan to divide the entire task into smaller subtasks, and then carrying out the subtasks according to the plan. To address the calculation errors and improve the quality of generated reasoning steps, we extend PS prompting with more detailed instructions and derive PS+ prompting. We evaluate our proposed prompting strategy on ten datasets across three reasoning problems. The experimental results over GPT-3 show that our proposed zero-shot prompting consistently outperforms Zero-shot-CoT across all datasets by a large margin, is comparable to or exceeds Zero-shot-Program-of-Thought Prompting, and has comparable performance with 8-shot CoT prompting on the math reasoning problem. The code can be found at https://github.com/AGI-Edgerunners/Plan-and-Solve-Prompting.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01991>fill in the blank exploring and enhancing llm capabilities for backward reasoning in math word problems</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While forward reasoning (i.e. find the answer given the question) has been explored extensively in the recent literature, backward reasoning is relatively unexplored. We examine the backward reasoning capabilities of LLMs on Math Word Problems (MWPs): given a mathematical question and its answer, with some details omitted from the question, can LLMs effectively retrieve the missing information? In this paper, we formally define the backward reasoning task on math word problems and modify three datasets to evaluate this task: GSM8k, SVAMP and MultiArith. Our findings show a significant drop in the accuracy of models on backward reasoning compared to forward reasoning across four SOTA LLMs (GPT4, GPT3.5, PaLM-2, and LLaMa-2). Utilizing the specific format of this task, we propose three novel techniques that improve performance: Rephrase reformulates the given problem into a forward reasoning problem, PAL-Tools combines the idea of Program-Aided LLMs to produce a set of equations that can be solved by an external solver, and Check your Work exploits the availability of natural verifier of high accuracy in the forward direction, interleaving solving and verification steps. Finally, realizing that each of our base methods correctly solves a different set of problems, we propose a novel Bayesian formulation for creating an ensemble over these base methods aided by a verifier to further boost the accuracy by a significant margin. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our techniques successively improve the performance of LLMs on the backward reasoning task, with the final ensemble-based method resulting in a substantial performance gain compared to the raw LLMs with standard prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16621>stress testing chainofthought prompting for large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This report examines the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in improving the multi-step reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by previous studies \cite{Min2022RethinkingWork}, we analyze the impact of three types of CoT prompt perturbations, namely CoT order, CoT values, and CoT operators on the performance of GPT-3 on various tasks. Our findings show that incorrect CoT prompting leads to poor performance on accuracy metrics. Correct values in the CoT is crucial for predicting correct answers. Moreover, incorrect demonstrations, where the CoT operators or the CoT order are wrong, do not affect the performance as drastically when compared to the value based perturbations. This research deepens our understanding of CoT prompting and opens some new questions regarding the capability of LLMs to learn reasoning in context.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03493>automatic chain of thought prompting in large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like&quot;Let&#x27;s think step by step&quot;to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The other uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer. The superior performance of the second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs with the&quot;Let&#x27;s think step by step&quot;prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one, i.e., let&#x27;s think not just step by step, but also one by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we find that diversity matters for automatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT prompting method: Auto-CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct demonstrations. On ten public benchmark reasoning tasks with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently matches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.

Those conversations contain importanttraces about individuals&#x27; health risks. Recently, researchers have exploitedthis online information to construct mental health detection models, which aimto identify users at risk on platforms like Twitter, Reddit or Facebook. Mostof these models are centred on achieving good classification results, ignoringthe explainability and interpretability of the decisions. Recent research haspointed out the importance of using clinical markers, such as the use ofsymptoms, to improve trust in the computational models by health professionals.In this paper, we propose using transformer-based architectures to detect andexplain the appearance of depressive symptom markers in the users&#x27; writings. Wepresent two approaches: i) train a model to classify, and another one toexplain the classifier&#x27;s decision separately and ii) unify the two taskssimultaneously using a single model. Additionally, for this latter manner, wealso investigated the performance of recent conversational LLMs when usingin-context learning. Our natural language explanations enable clinicians tointerpret the models&#x27; decisions based on validated symptoms, enhancing trust inthe automated process. We evaluate our approach using recent symptom-baseddatasets, employing both offline and expert-in-the-loop metrics to assess thequality of the explanations generated by our models.

We introduce a method for translating established, vetted social scientific constructs into AI objective functions, which we term societal objective functions, and demonstrate the method with application to the political science construct of anti-democratic attitudes. Traditionally, we have lacked observable outcomes to use to train such models, however, the social sciences have developed survey instruments and qualitative codebooks for these constructs, and their precision facilitates translation into detailed prompts for large language models. We apply this method to create a democratic attitude model that estimates the extent to which a social media post promotes anti-democratic attitudes, and test this democratic attitude model across three studies. In Study 1, we first test the attitudinal and behavioral effectiveness of the intervention among US partisans (N=1,380) by manually annotating (alpha=.895) social media posts with anti-democratic attitude scores and testing several feed ranking conditions based on these scores. Removal (d=.20) and downranking feeds (d=.25) reduced participants&#x27; partisan animosity without compromising their experience and engagement. In Study 2, we scale up the manual labels by creating the democratic attitude model, finding strong agreement with manual labels (rho=.75). Finally, in Study 3, we replicate Study 1 using the democratic attitude model instead of manual labels to test its attitudinal and behavioral impact (N=558), and again find that the feed downranking using the societal objective function reduced partisan animosity (d=.25). This method presents a novel strategy to draw on social science theory and methods to mitigate societal harms in social media AIs.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14456v1.pdf>framing the newsfrom human perception to large language model inferences</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Identifying the frames of news is important to understand the articles&#x27;vision, intention, message to be conveyed, and which aspects of the news areemphasized. Framing is a widely studied concept in journalism, and has emergedas a new topic in computing, with the potential to automate processes andfacilitate the work of journalism professionals. In this paper, we study thisissue with articles related to the Covid-19 anti-vaccine movement. First, tounderstand the perspectives used to treat this theme, we developed a protocolfor human labeling of frames for 1786 headlines of No-Vax movement articles ofEuropean newspapers from 5 countries. Headlines are key units in the writtenpress, and worth of analysis as many people only read headlines (or use them toguide their decision for further reading.)

Mental health issues such as depression, frustration, and hopelessness can directly or indirectly influence the emergence of suicidal thoughts. Early identification of these thoughts is crucial for timely diagnosis. In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have paved the way for revolutionizing mental health support and education. In this proof-of-concept study, we have created MindWatch, a cutting-edge tool that harnesses the power of AI-driven language models to serve as a valuable computer-aided system for the mental health professions to achieve two important goals such as early symptom detection, and personalized psychoeducation. We utilized ALBERT and Bio-Clinical BERT language models and fine-tuned them with the Reddit dataset to build the classifiers. We evaluated the performance of bi-LSTM, ALBERT, Bio-Clinical BERT, OpenAI GPT3.5 (via prompt engineering), and an ensembled voting classifier to detect suicide ideation. For personalized psychoeducation, we used the state-of-the-art Llama 2 foundation model leveraging prompt engineering. The tool is developed in the Amazon Web Service environment. All models performed exceptionally well, with accuracy and precision/recall greater than 92%. ALBERT performed better (AUC=.98) compared to the zero-shot classification accuracies obtained from OpenAI GPT3.5 Turbo (ChatGPT) on hidden datasets (AUC=.91). Furthermore, we observed that the inconclusiveness rate of the Llama 2 model is low while tested for few examples. This study emphasizes how transformer models can help provide customized psychoeducation to individuals dealing with mental health issues. By tailoring content to address their unique mental health conditions, treatment choices, and self-help resources, this approach empowers individuals to actively engage in their recovery journey. Additionally, these models have the potential to advance the automated detection of depressive disorders.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">4: ai human generative feedback users writing generated non intelligence students content expert quality tools process</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01798>exploring efl students&#x27; prompt engineering in humanai story writing an activity theory perspective</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This study applies Activity Theory to investigate how English as a foreign language (EFL) students prompt generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools during short story writing.

Co-audit tools complement prompt engineering techniques: one helps the user construct the input prompt, while the other helps them check the output response. As a specific example, this paper describes recent research on co-audit tools for spreadsheet computations powered by generative models. We explain why co-audit experiences are essential for any application of generative AI where quality is important and errors are consequential (as is common in spreadsheet computations). We propose a preliminary list of principles for co-audit, and outline research challenges.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18081v1.pdf>game of tones faculty detection of gpt4 generated content in university assessments</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  This study explores the robustness of university assessments against the useof Open AI&#x27;s Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) generated content andevaluates the ability of academic staff to detect its use when supported by theTurnitin Artificial Intelligence (AI) detection tool. The research involvedtwenty-two GPT-4 generated submissions being created and included in theassessment process to be marked by fifteen different faculty members. The studyreveals that although the detection tool identified 91% of the experimentalsubmissions as containing some AI-generated content, the total detected contentwas only 54.8%. This suggests that the use of adversarial techniques regardingprompt engineering is an effective method in evading AI detection tools andhighlights that improvements to AI detection software are needed. Using theTurnitin AI detect tool, faculty reported 54.5% of the experimental submissionsto the academic misconduct process, suggesting the need for increased awarenessand training into these tools. Genuine submissions received a mean score of54.4, whereas AI-generated content scored 52.3, indicating the comparableperformance of GPT-4 in real-life situations. Recommendations include adjustingassessment strategies to make them more resistant to the use of AI tools, usingAI-inclusive assessment where possible, and providing comprehensive trainingprograms for faculty and students.

This Perspective maps out principles and methods for usinggenerative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models(LLMs), to elevate the quality and efficiency of academic writing. We introducea human-AI collaborative framework that delineates the rationale (why), process(how), and nature (what) of AI engagement in writing. The framework pinpointsboth short-term and long-term reasons for engagement and their underlyingmechanisms (e.g., cognitive offloading and imaginative stimulation). It revealsthe role of AI throughout the writing process, conceptualized through atwo-stage model for human-AI collaborative writing, and the nature of AIassistance in writing, represented through a model of writing-assistance typesand levels. Building on this framework, we describe effective promptingtechniques for incorporating AI into the writing routine (outlining, drafting,and editing) as well as strategies for maintaining rigorous scholarship,adhering to varied journal policies, and avoiding overreliance on AI.Ultimately, the prudent integration of AI into academic writing can ease thecommunication burden, empower authors, accelerate discovery, and promotediversity in science.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05493>cases of efl secondary students&#x27; prompt engineering pathways to complete a writing task with chatgpt</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art (SOTA) chatbot. Although it has potential to support English as a foreign language (EFL) students&#x27; writing, to effectively collaborate with it, a student must learn to engineer prompts, that is, the skill of crafting appropriate instructions so that ChatGPT produces desired outputs. However, writing an appropriate prompt for ChatGPT is not straightforward for non-technical users who suffer a trial-and-error process. This paper examines the content of EFL students&#x27; ChatGPT prompts when completing a writing task and explores patterns in the quality and quantity of the prompts. The data come from iPad screen recordings of secondary school EFL students who used ChatGPT and other SOTA chatbots for the first time to complete the same writing task. The paper presents a case study of four distinct pathways that illustrate the trial-and-error process and show different combinations of prompt content and quantity. The cases contribute evidence for the need to provide prompt engineering education in the context of the EFL writing classroom, if students are to move beyond an individual trial-and-error process, learning a greater variety of prompt content and more sophisticated prompts to support their writing.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">5: code generation software programs program code_generation programming llms python generated cases codex test log automatically</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16557v1.pdf>effective test generation using pretrained large language models and mutation testing</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  One of the critical phases in software development is software testing.Testing helps with identifying potential bugs and reducing maintenance costs.The goal of automated test generation tools is to ease the development of testsby suggesting efficient bug-revealing tests. Recently, researchers haveleveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) of code to generate unit tests. Whilethe code coverage of generated tests was usually assessed, the literature hasacknowledged that the coverage is weakly correlated with the efficiency oftests in bug detection. To improve over this limitation, in this paper, weintroduce MuTAP for improving the effectiveness of test cases generated by LLMsin terms of revealing bugs by leveraging mutation testing. Our goal is achievedby augmenting prompts with surviving mutants, as those mutants highlight thelimitations of test cases in detecting bugs. MuTAP is capable of generatingeffective test cases in the absence of natural language descriptions of theProgram Under Test (PUTs). We employ different LLMs within MuTAP and evaluatetheir performance on different benchmarks. Our results show that our proposedmethod is able to detect up to 28% more faulty human-written code snippets.Among these, 17% remained undetected by both the current state-of-the-art fullyautomated test generation tool (i.e., Pynguin) and zero-shot/few-shot learningapproaches on LLMs. Furthermore, MuTAP achieves a Mutation Score (MS) of 93.57%on synthetic buggy code, outperforming all other approaches in our evaluation.Our findings suggest that although LLMs can serve as a useful tool to generatetest cases, they require specific post-processing steps to enhance theeffectiveness of the generated test cases which may suffer from syntactic orfunctional errors and may be ineffective in detecting certain types of bugs andtesting corner cases PUTs.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08191>a study on prompt design, advantages and limitations of chatgpt for deep learning program repair</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>ChatGPT has revolutionized many research and industrial fields. ChatGPT has shown great potential in software engineering to boost various traditional tasks such as program repair, code understanding, and code generation. However, whether automatic program repair (APR) applies to deep learning (DL) programs is still unknown. DL programs, whose decision logic is not explicitly encoded in the source code, have posed unique challenges to APR. While to repair DL programs, an APR approach needs to not only parse the source code syntactically but also needs to understand the code intention. With the best prior work, the performance of fault localization is still far less than satisfactory (only about 30\%). Therefore, in this paper, we explore ChatGPT&#x27;s capability for DL program repair by asking three research questions. (1) Can ChatGPT debug DL programs effectively? (2) How can ChatGPT&#x27;s repair performance be improved by prompting? (3) In which way can dialogue help facilitate the repair? On top of that, we categorize the common aspects useful for prompt design for DL program repair. Also, we propose various prompt templates to facilitate the performance and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT&#x27;s abilities such as detecting bad code smell, code refactoring, and detecting API misuse/deprecation.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17780v3.pdf>acecoder utilizing existing code to enhance code generation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in code generation.LLMs take as the input a prompt and output the code. A key question is how tomake prompts (i.e., Prompting Techniques). Existing prompting techniques aredesigned for natural language generation and have low accuracy in codegeneration.  In this paper, we propose a new prompting technique named AceCoder. Ourmotivation is that code generation meets two unique challenges (i.e.,requirement understanding and code implementation). AceCoder contains two novelmechanisms (i.e., guided code generation and example retrieval) to solve thesechallenges. (1) Guided code generation asks LLMs first to analyze requirementsand output an intermediate preliminary (e.g., test cases).

However, CoT prompting isdesigned for natural language generation and has low accuracy in codegeneration.  In this paper, we propose Structured CoTs (SCoTs) and present a novelprompting technique for code generation, named SCoT prompting. Our motivationis source code contains rich structural information and any code can becomposed of three program structures (i.e., sequence, branch, and loopstructures). Intuitively, structured intermediate reasoning steps make forstructured source code. Thus, we ask LLMs to use program structures to buildCoTs, obtaining SCoTs. Then, LLMs generate the final code based on SCoTs.Compared to CoT prompting, SCoT prompting explicitly constrains LLMs to thinkabout how to solve requirements from the view of source code and further theperformance of LLMs in code generation. We apply SCoT prompting to two LLMs(i.e., ChatGPT and Codex) and evaluate it on three benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval,MBPP, and MBCPP).

Prior methods using language models have demonstrated promising results, but they still struggle to prove even middle school level theorems. One common limitation of these methods is that they assume a fixed theorem library during the whole theorem proving process. However, as we all know, creating new useful theorems or even new theories is not only helpful but crucial and necessary for advancing mathematics and proving harder and deeper results. In this work, we present LEGO-Prover, which employs a growing skill library containing verified lemmas as skills to augment the capability of LLMs used in theorem proving. By constructing the proof modularly, LEGO-Prover enables LLMs to utilize existing skills retrieved from the library and to create new skills during the proving process. These skills are further evolved (by prompting an LLM) to enrich the library on another scale. Modular and reusable skills are constantly added to the library to enable tackling increasingly intricate mathematical problems. Moreover, the learned library further bridges the gap between human proofs and formal proofs by making it easier to impute missing steps. LEGO-Prover advances the state-of-the-art pass rate on miniF2F-valid (48.0% to 57.0%) and miniF2F-test (45.5% to 47.1%). During the proving process, LEGO-Prover also manages to generate over 20,000 skills (theorems/lemmas) and adds them to the growing library. Our ablation study indicates that these newly added skills are indeed helpful for proving theorems, resulting in an improvement from a success rate of 47.1% to 50.4%.

Some studies reveal that the performance of LLMs depends on boththe density and the position of the key information (question relevant) in theinput prompt. Inspired by these findings, we propose LongLLMLingua for promptcompression towards improving LLMs&#x27; perception of the key information tosimultaneously address the three challenges. We conduct evaluation on a widerange of long context scenarios including single-/multi-document QA, few-shotlearning, summarization, synthetic tasks, and code completion. The experimentalresults show that LongLLMLingua compressed prompt can derive higher performancewith much less cost. The latency of the end-to-end system is also reduced. Forexample, on NaturalQuestions benchmark, LongLLMLingua gains a performance boostof up to 17.1% over the original prompt with ~4x fewer tokens as input toGPT-3.5-Turbo.

Whileparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to reduce the memory usageof the optimizer state during fine-tuning, the inherent size of pre-trained LLMweights continues to be a pressing concern. Even though quantization techniquesare widely proposed to ease memory demands and accelerate LLM inference, mostof these techniques are geared towards the deployment phase. To bridge thisgap, this paper presents Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation(PEQA) - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFTwith quantized LLMs. By updating solely the quantization scales, PEQA can bedirectly applied to quantized LLMs, ensuring seamless task transitions.Parallel to existing PEFT methods, PEQA significantly reduces the memoryoverhead associated with the optimizer state. Furthermore, it leverages theadvantages of quantization to substantially reduce model sizes. Even afterfine-tuning, the quantization structure of a PEQA-tuned LLM remains intact,allowing for accelerated inference on the deployment stage. We employPEQA-tuning for task-specific adaptation on LLMs with up to 65 billionparameters. To assess the logical reasoning and language comprehension ofPEQA-tuned LLMs, we fine-tune low-bit quantized LLMs using a instructiondataset. Our results show that even when LLMs are quantized to below 4-bitprecision, their capabilities in language modeling, few-shot in-contextlearning, and comprehension can be resiliently restored to (or even improvedover) their full-precision original performances with PEQA.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00675>tool documentation enables zeroshot toolusage with large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Today, large language models (LLMs) are taught to use new tools by providing a few demonstrations of the tool&#x27;s usage. Unfortunately, demonstrations are hard to acquire, and can result in undesirable biased usage if the wrong demonstration is chosen. Even in the rare scenario that demonstrations are readily available, there is no principled selection protocol to determine how many and which ones to provide. As tasks grow more complex, the selection search grows combinatorially and invariably becomes intractable. Our work provides an alternative to demonstrations: tool documentation. We advocate the use of tool documentation, descriptions for the individual tool usage, over demonstrations. We substantiate our claim through three main empirical findings on 6 tasks across both vision and language modalities. First, on existing benchmarks, zero-shot prompts with only tool documentation are sufficient for eliciting proper tool usage, achieving performance on par with few-shot prompts. Second, on a newly collected realistic tool-use dataset with hundreds of available tool APIs, we show that tool documentation is significantly more valuable than demonstrations, with zero-shot documentation significantly outperforming few-shot without documentation. Third, we highlight the benefits of tool documentations by tackling image generation and video tracking using just-released unseen state-of-the-art models as tools. Finally, we highlight the possibility of using tool documentation to automatically enable new applications: by using nothing more than the documentation of GroundingDino, Stable Diffusion, XMem, and SAM, LLMs can re-invent the functionalities of the just-released Grounded-SAM and Track Anything models.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15556v2.pdf>tcrallm token compression retrieval augmented large language model for inference cost reduction</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Since ChatGPT released its API for public use, the number of applicationsbuilt on top of commercial large language models (LLMs) increase exponentially.One popular usage of such models is leveraging its in-context learning abilityand generating responses given user queries leveraging knowledge obtained byretrieval augmentation.

However, existing studies in this area rely heavily on large-scale supervised data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect. Thus, there is a need to address the challenge of few-shot multimodal sentiment analysis. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method called Multimodal Probabilistic Fusion Prompts (MultiPoint) that leverages diverse cues from different modalities for multimodal sentiment detection in the few-shot scenario. Specifically, we start by introducing a Consistently Distributed Sampling approach called CDS, which ensures that the few-shot dataset has the same category distribution as the full dataset. Unlike previous approaches primarily using prompts based on the text modality, we design unified multimodal prompts to reduce discrepancies between different modalities and dynamically incorporate multimodal demonstrations into the context of each multimodal instance. To enhance the model&#x27;s robustness, we introduce a probabilistic fusion method to fuse output predictions from multiple diverse prompts for each input. Our extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. First, our method outperforms strong baselines in the multimodal few-shot setting. Furthermore, under the same amount of data (1% of the full dataset), our CDS-based experimental results significantly outperform those based on previously sampled datasets constructed from the same number of instances of each class.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07126v1.pdf>instanceaware prompt learning for language understanding and generation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Recently, prompt learning has become a new paradigm to utilize pre-trainedlanguage models (PLMs) and achieves promising results in downstream tasks witha negligible increase of parameters.

However, a task may contain quitediverse samples in which some are easy and others are difficult, and diverseprompts are desirable. In this paper, we propose an instance-aware promptlearning method that learns a different prompt for each instance. Specifically,we suppose that each learnable prompt token has a different contribution todifferent instances, and we learn the contribution by calculating the relevancescore between an instance and each prompt token. The contribution weightedprompt would be instance aware.

To further improve the performance, prompt ensemble has attracted substantial interest for tackling the hallucination and instability of LLMs. However, existing methods usually adopt a two-stage paradigm, which requires a pre-prepared set of prompts with substantial manual effort, and is unable to perform directed optimization for different weak learners. In this paper, we propose a simple, universal, and automatic method named PREFER (Pompt Ensemble learning via Feedback-Reflect-Refine) to address the stated limitations. Specifically, given the fact that weak learners are supposed to focus on hard examples during boosting, PREFER builds a feedback mechanism for reflecting on the inadequacies of existing weak learners. Based on this, the LLM is required to automatically synthesize new prompts for iterative refinement. Moreover, to enhance stability of the prompt effect evaluation, we propose a novel prompt bagging method involving forward and backward thinking, which is superior to majority voting and is beneficial for both feedback and weight calculation in boosting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PREFER achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple types of tasks by a significant margin.

Instead ofmapping each label to a concrete word, our verbalizer maps each label to avector and picks the label that best captures the correlation between thestance and the target. Moreover, to alleviate the possible defect of dealingwith varying targets with a single hand-crafted prompt, we propose to distillthe information learned from multiple prompts. Experimental results show thesuperior performance of our proposed model in both full-data and few-shotscenarios.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">9: evaluation performance study analysis dataset human evaluate benchmark findings different including large conduct understanding work</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10678>understanding stereotypes in language models towards robust measurement and zeroshot debiasing</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Generated texts from large pretrained language models have been shown to exhibit a variety of harmful, human-like biases about various demographics. These findings prompted large efforts aiming to understand and measure such effects, with the goal of providing benchmarks that can guide the development of techniques mitigating these stereotypical associations. However, as recent research has pointed out, the current benchmarks lack a robust experimental setup, consequently hindering the inference of meaningful conclusions from their evaluation metrics. In this paper, we extend these arguments and demonstrate that existing techniques and benchmarks aiming to measure stereotypes tend to be inaccurate and consist of a high degree of experimental noise that severely limits the knowledge we can gain from benchmarking language models based on them. Accordingly, we propose a new framework for robustly measuring and quantifying biases exhibited by generative language models. Finally, we use this framework to investigate GPT-3&#x27;s occupational gender bias and propose prompting techniques for mitigating these biases without the need for fine-tuning.</p></details><li><a href=https://aclanthology.org/2023.nlrse-1.10.pdf>optr exploring the role of explanations in finetuning and prompting for reasoning skills of large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We conduct a thorough investigation into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing specifically on the Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT) models as a representative of such models. Our study entails finetuning three different sizes of OPT on a carefully curated reasoning corpus, resulting in two sets of finetuned models: OPT-R, finetuned without explanations, and OPT-RE, finetuned with explanations. We then evaluate all models on 57 out-of-domain tasks drawn from the Super-NaturalInstructions benchmark, covering 26 distinct reasoning skills, utilizing three prompting techniques. Through a comprehensive grid of 27 configurations and 6,156 test evaluations, we investigate the dimensions of finetuning, prompting, and scale to understand the role of explanations on different reasoning skills. Our findings reveal that having explanations in the fewshot exemplar has no significant impact on the model’s performance when the model is finetuned, while positively affecting the non-finetuned counterpart. Moreover, we observe a slight yet consistent increase in classification accuracy as we incorporate explanations during prompting and finetuning, respectively. Finally, we offer insights on which reasoning skills benefit the most from incorporating explanations during finetuning and prompting, such as Numerical (+20.4%) and Analogical (+13.9%) reasoning, as well as skills that exhibit negligible or negative effects.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08573>casteist but not racist quantifying disparities in large language model bias between india and the west</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), now used daily by millions of users, can encode societal biases, exposing their users to representational harms. A large body of scholarship on LLM bias exists but it predominantly adopts a Western-centric frame and attends comparatively less to bias levels and potential harms in the Global South. In this paper, we quantify stereotypical bias in popular LLMs according to an Indian-centric frame and compare bias levels between the Indian and Western contexts. To do this, we develop a novel dataset which we call Indian-BhED (Indian Bias Evaluation Dataset), containing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples for caste and religion contexts. We find that the majority of LLMs tested are strongly biased towards stereotypes in the Indian context, especially as compared to the Western context. We finally investigate Instruction Prompting as a simple intervention to mitigate such bias and find that it significantly reduces both stereotypical and anti-stereotypical biases in the majority of cases for GPT-3.5. The findings of this work highlight the need for including more diverse voices when evaluating LLMs.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00647v1.pdf>beyond task performance evaluating and reducing the flaws of large multimodal models with incontext learning</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Following the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Large MultimodalModels (LMMs), such as the Flamingo model and its subsequent competitors, havestarted to emerge as natural steps towards generalist agents. However,interacting with recent LMMs reveals major limitations that are hardly capturedby the current evaluation benchmarks. Indeed, task performances (e.g., VQAaccuracy) alone do not provide enough clues to understand their realcapabilities, limitations, and to which extent such models are aligned to humanexpectations. To refine our understanding of those flaws, we deviate from thecurrent evaluation paradigm and propose the EvALign-ICL framework, in which we(1) evaluate 8 recent open-source LMMs (based on the Flamingo architecture suchas OpenFlamingo and IDEFICS) on 5 different axes; hallucinations, abstention,compositionality, explainability and instruction following. Our evaluation onthese axes reveals major flaws in LMMs. To efficiently address these problems,and inspired by the success of in-context learning (ICL) in LLMs, (2) weexplore ICL as a solution and study how it affects these limitations. Based onour ICL study, (3) we push ICL further and propose new multimodal ICLapproaches such as; Multitask-ICL, Chain-of-Hindsight-ICL, andSelf-Correcting-ICL. Our findings are as follows; (1) Despite their success,LMMs have flaws that remain unsolved with scaling alone. (2) The effect of ICLon LMMs flaws is nuanced; despite its effectiveness for improvedexplainability, abstention, and instruction following, ICL does not improvecompositional abilities, and actually even amplifies hallucinations.

While there is a growing body of literature focusing on promptengineering, there is a lack of systematic analysis comparing the effects ofprompts across different models and tasks. To address this gap, we present acomprehensive prompt analysis based on the sensitivity of a function. Ouranalysis reveals that sensitivity is an unsupervised proxy for modelperformance, as it exhibits a strong negative correlation with accuracy. We usegradient-based saliency scores to empirically demonstrate how different promptsaffect the relevance of input tokens to the output, resulting in differentlevels of sensitivity. Furthermore, we introduce sensitivity-aware decodingwhich incorporates sensitivity estimation as a penalty term in the standardgreedy decoding. We show that this approach is particularly helpful wheninformation in the input is scarce.

A common approach for knowledge-intensive tasks is to employ a retrieve-then-read pipeline that first retrieves a handful of relevant contextual documents from an external corpus such as Wikipedia and then predicts an answer conditioned on the retrieved documents. In this paper, we present a novel perspective for solving knowledge-intensive tasks by replacing document retrievers with large language model generators. We call our method generate-then-read (GenRead), which first prompts a large language model to generate contextutal documents based on a given question, and then reads the generated documents to produce the final answer. Furthermore, we propose a novel clustering-based prompting method that selects distinct prompts, resulting in the generated documents that cover different perspectives, leading to better recall over acceptable answers. We conduct extensive experiments on three different knowledge-intensive tasks, including open-domain QA, fact checking, and dialogue system. Notably, GenRead achieves 71.6 and 54.4 exact match scores on TriviaQA and WebQ, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieve-then-read pipeline DPR-FiD by +4.0 and +3.9, without retrieving any documents from any external knowledge source.

Unfortunately, at this time, they also convincingly hallucinate incorrect answers, so that responses to questions must be verified against external sources before they can be accepted at face value. In this paper, we report two simple experiments to automatically validate generated answers against a corpus. We base our experiments on questions and passages from the MS MARCO (V1) test collection, and a retrieval pipeline consisting of sparse retrieval, dense retrieval and neural rerankers. In the first experiment, we validate the generated answer in its entirety. After presenting a question to an LLM and receiving a generated answer, we query the corpus with the combination of the question + generated answer. We then present the LLM with the combination of the question + generated answer + retrieved answer, prompting it to indicate if the generated answer can be supported by the retrieved answer. In the second experiment, we consider the generated answer at a more granular level, prompting the LLM to extract a list of factual statements from the answer and verifying each statement separately. We query the corpus with each factual statement and then present the LLM with the statement and the corresponding retrieved evidence. The LLM is prompted to indicate if the statement can be supported and make necessary edits using the retrieved material. With an accuracy of over 80%, we find that an LLM is capable of verifying its generated answer when a corpus of supporting material is provided. However, manual assessment of a random sample of questions reveals that incorrect generated answers are missed by this verification process. While this verification process can reduce hallucinations, it can not entirely eliminate them.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07289>beyond factuality a comprehensive evaluation of large language models as knowledge generators</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) outperform information retrieval techniques for downstream knowledge-intensive tasks when being prompted to generate world knowledge.

We conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the generated knowledge from three different types of LLMs on two widely studied knowledge-intensive tasks, i.e., open-domain question answering and knowledge-grounded dialogue. Surprisingly, our study reveals that the factuality of generated knowledge, even if lower, does not significantly hinder downstream tasks. Instead, the relevance and coherence of the outputs are more important than small factual mistakes. Further, we show how to use CONNER to improve knowledge-intensive tasks by designing two strategies: Prompt Engineering and Knowledge Selection.

At the heart of DFKD is to reconstruct a synthetic dataset by inverting the parameters of the uncompressed model. Prior DFKD approaches, however, have largely relied on hand-crafted priors of the target data distribution for the reconstruction, which can be inevitably biased and often incompetent to capture the intrinsic distributions. To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based method, termed as PromptDFD, that allows us to take advantage of learned language priors, which effectively harmonizes the synthetic sentences to be semantically and grammatically correct. Specifically, PromptDFD leverages a pre-trained generative model to provide language priors and introduces a reinforced topic prompter to control data synthesis, making the generated samples thematically relevant and semantically plausible, and thus friendly to downstream tasks. As shown in our experiments, the proposed method substantially improves the synthesis quality and achieves considerable improvements on distillation performance. In some cases, PromptDFD even gives rise to results on par with those from the data-driven knowledge distillation with access to the original training data.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08640v1.pdf>multistage collaborative knowledge distillation from large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  We study semi-supervised sequence prediction tasks where labeled data are tooscarce to effectively finetune a model and at the same time few-shot promptingof a large language model (LLM) has suboptimal performance.

To effectively extract regional features from regular image features and irregular point cloud features, we present a novel and unified position-assisted feature extraction module. Furthermore, training an MLLM from scratch is highly time-consuming. Thus, we propose incrementally extending existing pre-trained MLLMs to comprehend more modalities and the regional objects of those modalities. Specifically, we freeze the Q-Former from BLIP-2, an impressive MLLM, and optimize the modality-specific Lora parameters in Q-Former and LLM for each newly introduced modality.

We then employ contrastive learning in a Region Image Text Contrastive (RITC) network to compare the obtained foreground and background regions with the generated corpus. Our approach exploits the rich textual information from the open vocabulary as additional supervision, enabling the model to generate high-quality CAMs with a more complete object region and reduce false-activation of background regions. We conduct extensive analysis to validate the proposed method and show that our approach performs state-of-the-art on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">14: translation languages speech english machine multilingual cross machine_translation resource lingual translations quality pairs low transfer</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13294v3.pdf>adaptive machine translation with large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Consistency is a key requirement of high-quality translation. It isespecially important to adhere to pre-approved terminology and adapt tocorrected translations in domain-specific projects. Machine translation (MT)has achieved significant progress in the area of domain adaptation. However,real-time adaptation remains challenging. Large-scale language models (LLMs)have recently shown interesting capabilities of in-context learning, where theylearn to replicate certain input-output text generation patterns, withoutfurther fine-tuning. By feeding an LLM at inference time with a prompt thatconsists of a list of translation pairs, it can then simulate the domain andstyle characteristics. This work aims to investigate how we can utilizein-context learning to improve real-time adaptive MT. Our extensive experimentsshow promising results at translation time. For example, LLMs can adapt to aset of in-domain sentence pairs and/or terminology while translating a newsentence. We observe that the translation quality with few-shot in-contextlearning can surpass that of strong encoder-decoder MT systems, especially forhigh-resource languages. Moreover, we investigate whether we can combine MTfrom strong encoder-decoder models with fuzzy matches, which can furtherimprove translation quality, especially for less supported languages. Weconduct our experiments across five diverse language pairs, namelyEnglish-to-Arabic (EN-AR), English-to-Chinese (EN-ZH), English-to-French(EN-FR), English-to-Kinyarwanda (EN-RW), and English-to-Spanish (EN-ES).</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01448v2.pdf>alexatm 20b fewshot learning using a largescale multilingual seq2seq model</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  In this work, we demonstrate that multilingual large-scalesequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, pre-trained on a mixture of denoisingand Causal Language Modeling (CLM) tasks, are more efficient few-shot learnersthan decoder-only models on various tasks.

Yet, despite the fact that the amount of training data isgigantic, they still struggle with translating rare words, particularly forlow-resource languages. Even worse, it is usually unrealistic to retrieverelevant demonstrations for in-context learning with low-resource languages onLLMs, which restricts the practical use of LLMs for translation -- how shouldwe mitigate this problem? To this end, we present a novel method, CoD, whichaugments LLMs with prior knowledge with the chains of multilingual dictionariesfor a subset of input words to elicit translation abilities for LLMs. Extensiveexperiments indicate that augmenting ChatGPT with CoD elicits large gains by upto 13x chrF++ points for MNMT (3.08 to 42.63 for English to Serbian written inCyrillic script) on FLORES-200 full devtest set.

However, in low-resource languages, obtaining such hand-picked exemplars can still be challenging, where unsupervised techniques may be necessary. Moreover, competent generative capabilities of LLMs are observed only in high-resource languages, while their performances among under-represented languages fall behind due to pre-training data imbalance. To elicit LLMs&#x27; ability onto low-resource languages without any supervised data, we propose to assemble synthetic exemplars from a diverse set of high-resource languages to prompt the LLMs to translate from any language into English. These prompts are then used to create intra-lingual exemplars to perform tasks in the target languages. Our unsupervised prompting method performs on par with supervised few-shot learning in LLMs of different sizes for translations between English and 13 Indic and 21 African low-resource languages. We also show that fine-tuning a 7B model on data generated from our method helps it perform competitively with a 175B model. In non-English translation tasks, our method even outperforms supervised prompting by up to 3 chrF++ in many low-resource languages. When evaluated on zero-shot multilingual summarization, our method surpasses other English-pivoting baselines by up to 4 ROUGE-L and is also favored by GPT-4.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03175v1.pdf>genderspecific machine translation with large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential inmachine translation (MT), albeit with performance slightly lagging behindtraditional encoder-decoder Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems.

Materials and Methods We collected data from reports of surgical pathology and ultrasound from breast cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy from 2020 to 2022. We extracted the information using the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) for Sheets and Docs extension plugin and termed this the “LLM” method. The time and cost of developing the prompts with LLM methods were assessed and compared with those spent on collecting information with “full manual” and “LLM-assisted manual” methods. To assess accuracy, 340 patients were randomly selected, and the extracted information by LLM method were compared with those collected by “full manual” method. Results Data from 2,931 patients were collected. We developed 12 prompts for Extract function and 12 for Format function to extract and standardize the information. The overall accuracy was 87.7%. For lymphovascular invasion, it was 98.2%. Developing and processing the prompts took 3.5 hours and 15 minutes, respectively. Utilizing the ChatGPT application programming interface cost US $65.8 and when factoring in the estimated wage, the total cost was US $95.4. In an estimated comparison, “LLM-assisted manual” and “LLM” methods were time- and cost-efficient compared to the “full manual” method. Conclusion Developing and facilitating prompts for LLM to derive clinical factors was efficient to extract crucial information from huge medical records. This study demonstrated the potential of the application of natural language processing using LLM model in breast cancer patients. Prompts from the current study can be re-used for other research to collect clinical information.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13714>evaluation of gpt35 and gpt4 for supporting realworld information needs in healthcare delivery</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Despite growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) in healthcare, current explorations do not assess the real-world utility and safety of LLMs in clinical settings. Our objective was to determine whether two LLMs can serve information needs submitted by physicians as questions to an informatics consultation service in a safe and concordant manner. Sixty six questions from an informatics consult service were submitted to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via simple prompts. 12 physicians assessed the LLM responses&#x27; possibility of patient harm and concordance with existing reports from an informatics consultation service. Physician assessments were summarized based on majority vote. For no questions did a majority of physicians deem either LLM response as harmful. For GPT-3.5, responses to 8 questions were concordant with the informatics consult report, 20 discordant, and 9 were unable to be assessed. There were 29 responses with no majority on&quot;Agree&quot;,&quot;Disagree&quot;, and&quot;Unable to assess&quot;. For GPT-4, responses to 13 questions were concordant, 15 discordant, and 3 were unable to be assessed. There were 35 responses with no majority. Responses from both LLMs were largely devoid of overt harm, but less than 20% of the responses agreed with an answer from an informatics consultation service, responses contained hallucinated references, and physicians were divided on what constitutes harm. These results suggest that while general purpose LLMs are able to provide safe and credible responses, they often do not meet the specific information need of a given question. A definitive evaluation of the usefulness of LLMs in healthcare settings will likely require additional research on prompt engineering, calibration, and custom-tailoring of general purpose models.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07637>text2cohort democratizing the nci imaging data commons with natural language cohort discovery</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Imaging Data Commons (IDC) is a cloud-based database that provides researchers with open access to cancer imaging data, with the goal of facilitating collaboration in medical imaging research. However, querying the IDC database for cohort discovery and access to imaging data has a significant learning curve for researchers due to its complex nature. We developed Text2Cohort, a large language model (LLM) based toolkit to facilitate user-friendly and intuitive natural language cohort discovery in the IDC. Text2Cohorts translates user input into IDC database queries using prompt engineering and autocorrection and returns the query&#x27;s response to the user. Autocorrection resolves errors in queries by passing the errors back to the model for interpretation and correction. We evaluate Text2Cohort on 50 natural language user inputs ranging from information extraction to cohort discovery. The resulting queries and outputs were verified by two computer scientists to measure Text2Cohort&#x27;s accuracy and F1 score. Text2Cohort successfully generated queries and their responses with an 88% accuracy and F1 score of 0.94. However, it failed to generate queries for 6/50 (12%) user inputs due to syntax and semantic errors. Our results indicate that Text2Cohort succeeded at generating queries with correct responses, but occasionally failed due to a lack of understanding of the data schema. Despite these shortcomings, Text2Cohort demonstrates the utility of LLMs to enable researchers to discover and curate cohorts using data hosted on IDC with high levels of accuracy using natural language in a more intuitive and user-friendly way.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18341v2.pdf>cxrllava multimodal large language model for interpreting chest xray images</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Purpose: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expandedtheir capabilities in a multimodal fashion, potentially replicating the imageinterpretation of human radiologists. This study aimed to develop open-sourcemultimodal large language model for interpreting chest X-ray images(CXR-LLaVA). We also examined the effect of prompt engineering and modelparameters such as temperature and nucleus sampling.  Materials and Methods: For training, we collected 659,287 publicly availableCXRs: 417,336 CXRs had labels for certain radiographic abnormalities (dataset1); 241,951 CXRs provided free-text radiology reports (dataset 2). Afterpre-training the Resnet50 as an image encoder, the contrastive language-imagepre-training was used to align CXRs and corresponding radiographicabnormalities. Then, the Large Language Model Meta AI-2 was fine-tuned usingdataset 2, which were refined using GPT-4, with generating various questionanswering scenarios. The code can be found athttps://github.com/ECOFRI/CXR_LLaVA.  Results: In the test set, we observed that the model&#x27;s performance fluctuatedbased on its parameters. On average, it achieved F1 score of 0.34 for fivepathologic findings (atelectasis, cardiomegaly, consolidation, edema, andpleural effusion), which was improved to 0.46 through prompt engineering. Inthe independent set, the model achieved an average F1 score of 0.30 for thesame pathologic findings. Notably, for the pediatric chest radiograph dataset,which was unseen during training, the model differentiated abnormal radiographswith an F1 score ranging from 0.84 to 0.85.

This leads to a significant drop in performance in domains like Scientific Claim Correction, where good verification models do not always exist. In this work, we introduce a claim correction system that makes no domain assumptions and does not require a verifier but is able to outperform existing methods by an order of magnitude — achieving 94% correction accuracy on the SciFact dataset, and 62.5% on the SciFact-Open dataset, compared to the next best meth-ods 0.5% and 1.50% respectively. Our method leverages the power of prompting with LLMs during training to create a richly annotated dataset that can be used for fully supervised training and regularization. We additionally use a claim-aware decoding procedure to improve the quality of corrected claims. Our method is competitive with the very LLM that was used to generate the annotated dataset — with GPT3.5 achieving 89.5% and 60% correction accuracy on SciFact and SciFact-Open, despite using 1250 times as many parameters as our model.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">16: attacks llms adversarial attack jailbreak vulnerabilities safety injection robustness content security harmful framework detection instructions</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03825>do anything now characterizing and evaluating inthewild jailbreak prompts on large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The misuse of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention from the general public and LLM vendors.

To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios.

Unfortunately, there has been a rising concern that LLMs can be misused to generate harmful or malicious content. Though a line of research has focused on aligning LLMs with human values and preventing them from producing inappropriate content, such alignments are usually vulnerable and can be bypassed by alignment-breaking attacks via adversarially optimized or handcrafted jailbreaking prompts. In this work, we introduce a Robustly Aligned LLM (RA-LLM) to defend against potential alignment-breaking attacks. RA-LLM can be directly constructed upon an existing aligned LLM with a robust alignment checking function, without requiring any expensive retraining or fine-tuning process of the original LLM. Furthermore, we also provide a theoretical analysis for RA-LLM to verify its effectiveness in defending against alignment-breaking attacks. Through real-world experiments on open-source large language models, we demonstrate that RA-LLM can successfully defend against both state-of-the-art adversarial prompts and popular handcrafted jailbreaking prompts by reducing their attack success rates from nearly 100\% to around 10\% or less.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08487>latent jailbreak a benchmark for evaluating text safety and output robustness of large language models</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Considerable research efforts have been devoted to ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human values and generate safe text. However, an excessive focus on sensitivity to certain topics can compromise the model&#x27;s robustness in following instructions, thereby impacting its overall performance in completing tasks. Previous benchmarks for jailbreaking LLMs have primarily focused on evaluating the safety of the models without considering their robustness. In this paper, we propose a benchmark that assesses both the safety and robustness of LLMs, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach. To comprehensively study text safety and output robustness, we introduce a latent jailbreak prompt dataset, each involving malicious instruction embedding. Specifically, we instruct the model to complete a regular task, such as translation, with the text to be translated containing malicious instructions. To further analyze safety and robustness, we design a hierarchical annotation framework. We present a systematic analysis of the safety and robustness of LLMs regarding the position of explicit normal instructions, word replacements (verbs in explicit normal instructions, target groups in malicious instructions, cue words for explicit normal instructions), and instruction replacements (different explicit normal instructions). Our results demonstrate that current LLMs not only prioritize certain instruction verbs but also exhibit varying jailbreak rates for different instruction verbs in explicit normal instructions.

Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methodssatisfy the criteria of being truly &quot;general&quot;, i.e., automatic, discrete,black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, weintroduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methodswith over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within ourparadigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing,genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search,demonstrating their effectiveness in black-box prompt learning andChain-of-Thought prompt tuning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can beused to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previouslyunknown, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in promptoptimization.

Patients presenting in shock require prompt optimization of volume status and cardiac out- put to ensure adequate perfusion. Poor optimization may be associated with prolonged hospital and intensive care unit stays. The prior gold standard, pulmonary artery catheterization, is rarely available in the emergency department setting and its invasive nature has led to recent re-evaluation of its clinical utility. However, there are new monitoring technologies that are being studied in the intensive care unit setting that may soon be available in emergency departments to aid in nursing and physician decision making to improve acute resuscitation.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01065>optimizing mobileedge aigenerated everything (aigx) services by prompt engineering fundamental, framework, and case study</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As the next-generation paradigm for content creation, AI-Generated Content (AIGC), i.e., generating content automatically by Generative AI (GAI) based on user prompts, has gained great attention and success recently. With the ever-increasing power of GAI, especially the emergence of Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) that contain billions of parameters and prompt engineering methods (i.e., finding the best prompts for the given task), the application range of AIGC is rapidly expanding, covering various forms of information for human, systems, and networks, such as network designs, channel coding, and optimization solutions. In this article, we present the concept of mobile-edge AI-Generated Everything (AIGX). Specifically, we first review the building blocks of AIGX, the evolution from AIGC to AIGX, as well as practical AIGX applications. Then, we present a unified mobile-edge AIGX framework, which employs edge devices to provide PFM-empowered AIGX services and optimizes such services via prompt engineering. More importantly, we demonstrate that suboptimal prompts lead to poor generation quality, which adversely affects user satisfaction, edge network performance, and resource utilization. Accordingly, we conduct a case study, showcasing how to train an effective prompt optimizer using ChatGPT and investigating how much improvement is possible with prompt engineering in terms of user experience, quality of generation, and network performance.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">19: human agent robot planning agents learning policy decision environment rl reinforcement_learning game reinforcement feedback level</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01872v1.pdf>thespian multicharacter text roleplaying game agents</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Text-adventure games and text role-playing games are grand challenges forreinforcement learning game playing agents.

Can we instead cheaply design rewards using a natural language interface? This paper explores how to simplify reward design by prompting a large language model (LLM) such as GPT-3 as a proxy reward function, where the user provides a textual prompt containing a few examples (few-shot) or a description (zero-shot) of the desired behavior. Our approach leverages this proxy reward function in an RL framework. Specifically, users specify a prompt once at the beginning of training. During training, the LLM evaluates an RL agent&#x27;s behavior against the desired behavior described by the prompt and outputs a corresponding reward signal. The RL agent then uses this reward to update its behavior. We evaluate whether our approach can train agents aligned with user objectives in the Ultimatum Game, matrix games, and the DealOrNoDeal negotiation task. In all three tasks, we show that RL agents trained with our framework are well-aligned with the user&#x27;s objectives and outperform RL agents trained with reward functions learned via supervised learning</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01084v1.pdf>robotic interestingness via humaninformed fewshot object detection</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Interestingness recognition is crucial for decision making in autonomousexploration for mobile robots.

However, most existing methods either take actions greedily without planning or rely on static plans that are not adaptable to environmental feedback. Consequently, the sequential decision-making performance of LLM agents degenerates with problem complexity and plan horizons increase. We propose a closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback. In AdaPlanner, the LLM agent adaptively refines its plan from feedback with both in-plan and out-of-plan refinement strategies. To mitigate hallucination, we develop a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a skill discovery mechanism that leverages successful plans as few-shot exemplars, enabling the agent to plan and refine with fewer task demonstrations. Our experiments in the ALFWorld and MiniWoB++ environments demonstrate that AdaPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 3.73% and 4.11% while utilizing 2x and 600x fewer samples, respectively.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">20: engineering chatgpt prompt_engineering research paper potential future like gpt-4 study challenges applications provide including use</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00855>review of large vision models and visual prompt engineering</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Visual prompt engineering is a fundamental technology in the field of visual and image Artificial General Intelligence, serving as a key component for achieving zero-shot capabilities.

The standardapproach for ICL is to prompt the LM with concatenated demonstrations followedby the test input. This approach suffers from some issues. First, concatenationoffers almost no control over the contribution of each demo to the modelprediction. This can be sub-optimal when some demonstrations are irrelevant tothe test example. Second, due to the input length limit of some transformermodels, it might be infeasible to fit many examples into the context,especially when dealing with long-input tasks. In this work, we exploreDemonstration Ensembling (DENSE) as an alternative to simple concatenation.DENSE predicts outputs using subsets (i.e., buckets) of the demonstrations andthen combines the output probabilities resulting from each subset to producethe final prediction.

We investigate two setups-ICL with flipped labels and ICL with semantically-unrelated labels-across various model families (GPT-3, InstructGPT, Codex, PaLM, and Flan-PaLM). First, experiments on ICL with flipped labels show that overriding semantic priors is an emergent ability of model scale. While small language models ignore flipped labels presented in-context and thus rely primarily on semantic priors from pretraining, large models can override semantic priors when presented with in-context exemplars that contradict priors, despite the stronger semantic priors that larger models may hold. We next study semantically-unrelated label ICL (SUL-ICL), in which labels are semantically unrelated to their inputs (e.g., foo/bar instead of negative/positive), thereby forcing language models to learn the input-label mappings shown in in-context exemplars in order to perform the task. The ability to do SUL-ICL also emerges primarily with scale, and large-enough language models can even perform linear classification in a SUL-ICL setting. Finally, we evaluate instruction-tuned models and find that instruction tuning strengthens both the use of semantic priors and the capacity to learn input-label mappings, but more of the former.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12375v3.pdf>incontext learning learns label relationships but is not conventional learning</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  The predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) on downstream tasks oftenimprove significantly when including examples of the input--label relationshipin the context.

To ensure we obtain acomprehensive picture of ICL behavior, we study probabilistic aspects of ICLpredictions and thoroughly examine the dynamics of ICL as more examples areprovided. Our experiments show that ICL predictions almost always depend onin-context labels, and that ICL can learn truly novel tasks in-context.However, we also find that ICL struggles to fully overcome predictionpreferences acquired from pre-training data, and, further, that ICL does notconsider all in-context information equally.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05698v3.pdf>compositional exemplars for incontext learning</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Large pretrained language models (LMs) have shown impressive In-ContextLearning (ICL) ability, where the model learns to do an unseen task via aprompt consisting of input-output examples as the demonstration, without anyparameter updates.

Then, we find that changing the distribution ofthe covariates and weight vector to a non-isotropic Gaussian distribution has astrong impact on the learned algorithm: the global minimizer of thepre-training loss now implements a single step of $\textit{pre-conditioned}$GD. However, if only the distribution of the responses is changed, then thisdoes not have a large effect on the learned algorithm: even when the responsecomes from a more general family of $\textit{nonlinear}$ functions, the globalminimizer of the pre-training loss still implements a single step of GD on aleast-squares linear regression objective.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04891v1.pdf>incontext learning through the bayesian prism</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  In-context learning is one of the surprising and useful features of largelanguage models. How it works is an active area of research. Recently, stylizedmeta-learning-like setups have been devised that train these models on asequence of input-output pairs $(x, f(x))$ from a function class using thelanguage modeling loss and observe generalization to unseen functions from thesame class. One of the main discoveries in this line of research has been thatfor several problems such as linear regression, trained transformers learnalgorithms for learning functions in context. However, the inductive biases ofthese models resulting in this behavior are not clearly understood. A modelwith unlimited training data and compute is a Bayesian predictor: it learns thepretraining distribution. It has been shown that high-capacity transformersmimic the Bayesian predictor for linear regression. In this paper, we showempirical evidence of transformers exhibiting the behavior of this ideallearner across different linear and non-linear function classes. We also extendthe previous setups to work in the multitask setting and verify thattransformers can do in-context learning in this setup as well and the Bayesianperspective sheds light on this setting also.

This raises a foundational question: can ICLsolve fundamentally $\textit{new}$ tasks that are very different from thoseseen during pretraining? To probe this question, we examine ICL&#x27;s performanceon linear regression while varying the diversity of tasks in the pretrainingdataset. We empirically demonstrate a $\textit{task diversity threshold}$ forthe emergence of ICL. Below this threshold, the pretrained transformer cannotsolve unseen regression tasks, instead behaving like a Bayesian estimator withthe $\textit{non-diverse pretraining task distribution}$ as the prior. Beyondthis threshold, the transformer significantly outperforms this estimator; itsbehavior aligns with that of ridge regression, corresponding to a Gaussianprior over $\textit{all tasks}$, including those not seen during pretraining.Thus, when pretrained on data with task diversity greater than the threshold,transformers $\textit{can}$ optimally solve fundamentally new tasks in-context.Importantly, this capability hinges on it deviating from the Bayes optimalestimator with the pretraining distribution as the prior. This study alsoexplores the effect of regularization, model capacity and task structure andunderscores, in a concrete example, the critical role of task diversity,alongside data and model scale, in the emergence of ICL.

By embedding asequence of labeled training data and unlabeled test data as a prompt, thisallows for transformers to behave like supervised learning algorithms. Indeed,recent work has shown that when training transformer architectures over randominstances of linear regression problems, these models&#x27; predictions mimic thoseof ordinary least squares.  Towards understanding the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, weinvestigate the dynamics of ICL in transformers with a single linearself-attention layer trained by gradient flow on linear regression tasks. Weshow that despite non-convexity, gradient flow with a suitable randominitialization finds a global minimum of the objective function. At this globalminimum, when given a test prompt of labeled examples from a new predictiontask, the transformer achieves prediction error competitive with the bestlinear predictor over the test prompt distribution. We additionallycharacterize the robustness of the trained transformer to a variety ofdistribution shifts and show that although a number of shifts are tolerated,shifts in the covariate distribution of the prompts are not. Motivated by this,we consider a generalized ICL setting where the covariate distributions canvary across prompts. We show that although gradient flow succeeds at finding aglobal minimum in this setting, the trained transformer is still brittle undermild covariate shifts. We complement this finding with experiments on large,nonlinear transformer architectures which we show are more robust undercovariate shifts.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04637v2.pdf>transformers as statisticians provable incontext learning with incontext algorithm selection</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Neural sequence models based on the transformer architecture havedemonstrated remarkable \emph{in-context learning} (ICL) abilities, where theycan perform new tasks when prompted with training and test examples, withoutany parameter update to the model. This work first provides a comprehensivestatistical theory for transformers to perform ICL. Concretely, we show thattransformers can implement a broad class of standard machine learningalgorithms in context, such as least squares, ridge regression, Lasso, learninggeneralized linear models, and gradient descent on two-layer neural networks,with near-optimal predictive power on various in-context data distributions.Using an efficient implementation of in-context gradient descent as theunderlying mechanism, our transformer constructions admit mild size bounds, andcan be learned with polynomially many pretraining sequences.  Building on these ``base&#x27;&#x27; ICL algorithms, intriguingly, we show thattransformers can implement more complex ICL procedures involving\emph{in-context algorithm selection}, akin to what a statistician can do inreal life -- A \emph{single} transformer can adaptively select different baseICL algorithms -- or even perform qualitatively different tasks -- on differentinput sequences, without any explicit prompting of the right algorithm or task.We both establish this in theory by explicit constructions, and also observethis phenomenon experimentally. In theory, we construct two general mechanismsfor algorithm selection with concrete examples: pre-ICL testing, and post-ICLvalidation. As an example, we use the post-ICL validation mechanism toconstruct a transformer that can perform nearly Bayes-optimal ICL on achallenging task -- noisy linear models with mixed noise levels.Experimentally, we demonstrate the strong in-context algorithm selectioncapabilities of standard transformer architectures.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">23: user dialogue system systems conversational users recommendation parsing oriented human semantic responses based dialogues generation</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01475>prompt tuning large language models on personalized aspect extraction for recommendations</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Existing aspect extraction methods mostly rely on explicit or ground truth aspect information, or using data mining or machine learning approaches to extract aspects from implicit user feedback such as user reviews. It however remains under-explored how the extracted aspects can help generate more meaningful recommendations to the users. Meanwhile, existing research on aspect-based recommendations often relies on separate aspect extraction models or assumes the aspects are given, without accounting for the fact the optimal set of aspects could be dependent on the recommendation task at hand. In this work, we propose to combine aspect extraction together with aspect-based recommendations in an end-to-end manner, achieving the two goals together in a single framework. For the aspect extraction component, we leverage the recent advances in large language models and design a new prompt learning mechanism to generate aspects for the end recommendation task. For the aspect-based recommendation component, the extracted aspects are concatenated with the usual user and item features used by the recommendation model. The recommendation task mediates the learning of the user embeddings and item embeddings, which are used as soft prompts to generate aspects. Therefore, the extracted aspects are personalized and contextualized by the recommendation task. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments on three industrial datasets, where our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both the personalized aspect extraction and aspect-based recommendation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate that it is necessary and beneficial to combine the learning of aspect extraction and aspect-based recommendation together.

These intricacies manifest in the form of increased complexity in contextual interactions, extended dialogue sessions encompassing a diverse array of topics, and more frequent contextual shifts. To handle these intricacies arising from evolving LLM-based chat systems, we propose joint dialogue segmentation and state tracking per segment in open-domain dialogue systems. Assuming a zero-shot setting appropriate to a true open-domain dialogue system, we propose S3-DST, a structured prompting technique that harnesses Pre-Analytical Recollection, a novel grounding mechanism we designed for improving long context tracking. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in joint segmentation and state tracking, we evaluate S3-DST on a proprietary anonymized open-domain dialogue dataset, as well as publicly available DST and segmentation datasets. Across all datasets and settings, S3-DST consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating its potency and robustness the next generation of LLM-based chat systems.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00085v2.pdf>reasoning before responding integrating commonsensebased causality explanation for empathetic response generation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  Recent approaches to empathetic response generation try to incorporatecommonsense knowledge or reasoning about the causes of emotions to betterunderstand the user&#x27;s experiences and feelings. However, these approachesmainly focus on understanding the causalities of context from the user&#x27;sperspective, ignoring the system&#x27;s perspective. In this paper, we propose acommonsense-based causality explanation approach for diverse empatheticresponse generation that considers both the user&#x27;s perspective (user&#x27;s desiresand reactions) and the system&#x27;s perspective (system&#x27;s intentions andreactions). We enhance ChatGPT&#x27;s ability to reason for the system&#x27;s perspectiveby integrating in-context learning with commonsense knowledge. Then, weintegrate the commonsense-based causality explanation with both ChatGPT and aT5-based model. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our methodoutperforms other comparable methods on both automatic and human evaluations.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10168v1.pdf>fewshot adaptation for parsing contextual utterances with llms</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  We evaluate the ability of semantic parsers based on large language models(LLMs) to handle contextual utterances. In real-world settings, there typicallyexists only a limited number of annotated contextual utterances due toannotation cost, resulting in an imbalance compared to non-contextualutterances. Therefore, parsers must adapt to contextual utterances with a fewtraining examples. We examine four major paradigms for doing so inconversational semantic parsing i.e., Parse-with-Utterance-History,Parse-with-Reference-Program, Parse-then-Resolve, and Rewrite-then-Parse. Tofacilitate such cross-paradigm comparisons, we constructSMCalFlow-EventQueries, a subset of contextual examples from SMCalFlow withadditional annotations. Experiments with in-context learning and fine-tuningsuggest that Rewrite-then-Parse is the most promising paradigm whenholistically considering parsing accuracy, annotation cost, and error types.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14524>chatrec towards interactive and explainable llmsaugmented recommender system</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their significant potential to be applied for addressing various application tasks. However, traditional recommender systems continue to face great challenges such as poor interactivity and explainability, which actually also hinder their broad deployment in real-world systems. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel paradigm called Chat-Rec (ChatGPT Augmented Recommender System) that innovatively augments LLMs for building conversational recommender systems by converting user profiles and historical interactions into prompts. Chat-Rec is demonstrated to be effective in learning user preferences and establishing connections between users and products through in-context learning, which also makes the recommendation process more interactive and explainable. What&#x27;s more, within the Chat-Rec framework, user&#x27;s preferences can transfer to different products for cross-domain recommendations, and prompt-based injection of information into LLMs can also handle the cold-start scenarios with new items. In our experiments, Chat-Rec effectively improve the results of top-k recommendations and performs better in zero-shot rating prediction task. Chat-Rec offers a novel approach to improving recommender systems and presents new practical scenarios for the implementation of AIGC (AI generated content) in recommender system studies.</p></details></ul></details></div><div class="topic-container"><div class="topic"><input type="checkbox" class="topic-checkbox">24: extraction entity plms templates task relation template event label information sentence prediction entities prompt_templates based</div><details><summary>Documents</summary><ul><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.04539v2.pdf>promptbased zeroshot relation extraction with semantic knowledge augmentation</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>  In relation triplet extraction (RTE), recognizing unseen (new) relations forwhich there are no training instances is a challenging task. Efforts have beenmade to recognize unseen relations based on question-answering models orrelation descriptions. However, these approaches miss the semantic informationabout connections between seen and unseen relations. In this paper, We proposea prompt-based model with semantic knowledge augmentation (ZS-SKA) to recognizeunseen relations under the zero-shot setting. We present a new word-levelanalogy-based sentence translation rule and generate augmented instances withunseen relations from instances with seen relations using that new rule. Wedesign prompts with weighted virtual label construction based on an externalknowledge graph to integrate semantic knowledge information learned from seenrelations. Instead of using the actual label sets in the prompt template, weconstruct weighted virtual label words. We learn the representations of bothseen and unseen relations with augmented instances and prompts. We thencalculate the distance between the generated representations using prototypicalnetworks to predict unseen relations. Extensive experiments conducted on threepublic datasets FewRel, Wiki-ZSL, and NYT, show that ZS-SKA outperformsstate-of-the-art methods under the zero-shot scenarios. Our experimentalresults also demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ZS-SKA.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05987>ccprompt counterfactual contrastive prompttuning for manyclass classification</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>With the success of the prompt-tuning paradigm in Natural Language Processing (NLP), various prompt templates have been proposed to further stimulate specific knowledge for serving downstream tasks, e.g., machine translation, text generation, relation extraction, and so on. Existing prompt templates are mainly shared among all training samples with the information of task description. However, training samples are quite diverse. The sharing task description is unable to stimulate the unique task-related information in each training sample, especially for tasks with the finite-label space. To exploit the unique task-related information, we imitate the human decision process which aims to find the contrastive attributes between the objective factual and their potential counterfactuals. Thus, we propose the \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{Prompt}-Tuning (CCPrompt) approach for many-class classification, e.g., relation classification, topic classification, and entity typing. Compared with simple classification tasks, these tasks have more complex finite-label spaces and are more rigorous for prompts. First of all, we prune the finite label space to construct fact-counterfactual pairs. Then, we exploit the contrastive attributes by projecting training instances onto every fact-counterfactual pair. We further set up global prototypes corresponding with all contrastive attributes for selecting valid contrastive attributes as additional tokens in the prompt template. Finally, a simple Siamese representation learning is employed to enhance the robustness of the model. We conduct experiments on relation classification, topic classification, and entity typing tasks in both fully supervised setting and few-shot setting. The results indicate that our model outperforms former baselines.</p></details><li><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.09101>relationprompt leveraging prompts to generate synthetic data for zeroshot relation triplet extraction</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Despite the importance of relation extraction in building and representing knowledge, less research is focused on generalizing to unseen relations types. We introduce the task setting of Zero-Shot Relation Triplet Extraction (ZeroRTE) to encourage further research in low-resource relation extraction methods. Given an input sentence, each extracted triplet consists of the head entity, relation label, and tail entity where the relation label is not seen at the training stage. To solve ZeroRTE, we propose to synthesize relation examples by prompting language models to generate structured texts. Concretely, we unify language model prompts and structured text approaches to design a structured prompt template for generating synthetic relation samples when conditioning on relation label prompts (RelationPrompt). To overcome the limitation for extracting multiple relation triplets in a sentence, we design a novel Triplet Search Decoding method. Experiments on FewRel and Wiki-ZSL datasets show the efficacy of RelationPrompt for the ZeroRTE task and zero-shot relation classification. Our code and data are available at github.com/declare-lab/RelationPrompt.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07650>knowprompt knowledgeaware prompttuning with synergistic optimization for relation extraction</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, prompt-tuning has achieved promising results for specific few-shot classification tasks. The core idea of prompt-tuning is to insert text pieces (i.e., templates) into the input and transform a classification task into a masked language modeling problem. However, for relation extraction, determining an appropriate prompt template requires domain expertise, and it is cumbersome and time-consuming to obtain a suitable label word. Furthermore, there exists abundant semantic and prior knowledge among the relation labels that cannot be ignored. To this end, we focus on incorporating knowledge among relation labels into prompt-tuning for relation extraction and propose a Knowledge-aware Prompt-tuning approach with synergistic optimization (KnowPrompt). Specifically, we inject latent knowledge contained in relation labels into prompt construction with learnable virtual type words and answer words. Then, we synergistically optimize their representation with structured constraints. Extensive experimental results on five datasets with standard and low-resource settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and datasets are available in GitHub1 for reproducibility.</p></details><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02483>continuous prompt tuning based textual entailment model for ecommerce entity typing</a></li><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The explosion of e-commerce has caused the need for processing and analysis of product titles, like entity typing in product titles. However, the rapid activity in e-commerce has led to the rapid emergence of new entities, which is difficult for general entity typing. Besides, product titles in e-commerce have very different language styles from text data in general domain. In order to handle new entities in product titles and address the special language styles of product titles in e-commerce domain, we propose our textual entailment model with continuous prompt tuning based hypotheses and fusion embeddings for e-commerce entity typing. First, we reformulate entity typing into a textual entailment problem to handle new entities that are not present during training. Second, we design a model to automatically generate textual entailment hypotheses using a continuous prompt tuning method, which can generate better textual entailment hypotheses without manual design. Third, we utilize the fusion embeddings of BERT embedding and Char-acterBERT embedding to solve the problem that the language styles of product titles in e-commerce are different from that of general domain. To analyze the effect of each contribution, we compare the performance of entity typing and textual entailment model, and conduct ablation studies on continuous prompt tuning and fusion embeddings. We also evaluate the impact of different prompt template initialization for the continuous prompt tuning. We show our proposed model improves the average F1 score by around 2% compared to the baseline BERT entity typing model.</p></details></ul></details></div>
