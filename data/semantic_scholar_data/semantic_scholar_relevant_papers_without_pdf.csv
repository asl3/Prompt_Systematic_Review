Therefore, it is moderately relevant to the broader topic of prompt engineering but does not focus on a 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts.'"
chain of thought prompt tuning in vision language models,7,"The document discusses 'chain of thought prompt tuning in vision language models,' which is a specific method within prompt engineering that aims at improving the reasoning process of AI models in image-related tasks. While the topic is closely related to the concept of prompt engineering, it is more narrowly focused on vision-language models and does not directly touch on 'hard prefix prompts' which seems to be the focus of the initial inquiry. The relevance is rated as 7 since the technique of chain of thought prompting falls under the wider umbrella of prompt engineering strategies and contributes to the field, even if it is not a direct study on hard prefix prompts."
symbolic math reasoning with language models,7,"The abstract provided discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3 for solving math word problems and explores their reasoning capabilities. Although the primary focus is on these models' ability to solve mathematical problems symbolically and numerically, it does mention the role of specific prompting techniques and their influence on the model's problem-solving process. Therefore, while the abstract is not directly focused on a review of 'hard prefix prompts,' it does pertain to prompt engineering in the broader context of eliciting reasoning and explanations from a language model. This justifies a moderate-to-high relevance rating, as the paper could potentially contribute valuable insights into the efficacy of prompting strategies in complex problem-solving tasks with language models."

This directly relates to the field of prompt engineering, as it concerns the design and testing of prompts that efficiently guide a language model to perform domain-specific tasks. However, the study does not explicitly mention 'hard prefix prompts' or a 'systematic review' of such prompts, but rather it is an example of applied prompt engineering in a practical, task-oriented context. Therefore, the relevance is high but not absolute, hence a rating of 7."
enhancing cross-lingual natural language inference by soft prompting with language-independent knowledge,7,"The abstract discusses 'Soft prompt learning framework' and its application in cross-lingual natural language inference, which is relevant to prompt engineering as it deals with a form of prompts—soft prompts. Although it does not specifically address 'hard prefix prompts,' which the original prompt inquires about, the study of soft prompts is related and contributes to the broader field of prompt engineering. It would be more relevant if the specifics of 'hard prefix prompts' were examined, therefore it doesn't receive a full score."
from images to textual prompts: zero-shot visual question answering with frozen large language models,9,"The abstract describes a method (Img2LLM) involving the generation of prompts that effectively allow large language models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. This is highly relevant to prompt engineering because Img2LLM essentially acts as a prompt engineering tool, transforming image content into textual prompts that enable LLMs to understand and respond to visual data without the need for end-to-end training. It directly involves the design and application of effective prompts to improve the utility of LLMs in a cross-modality context. The only reason it does not receive a full 10 rating is because it specifically pertains to visual data and VQA, whereas prompt engineering can also encompass other forms of data and tasks."

It demonstrates a practical application of prompt engineering in the form of OpenPrompt and hybrid prompts, providing relevant outcomes like the improvement in F1 score and accuracy when using such prompts. This study helps in understanding prompt-based methods, hence the high relevance rating to prompt engineering. Only a full read-through could confirm if it tackles 'hard prefix prompts' specifically, but the mention of hybrid prompts with [mask] slots strongly suggests relevance to the field of prompt engineering."
vima: robot manipulation with multimodal prompts,8,"The study described in the abstract illustrates a novel application of prompt-based learning in the domain of robotics rather than just natural language processing. The use of 'multimodal prompts' that includes both textual and visual tokens is directly related to the concept of prompt engineering, as it involves crafting prompts that a machine learning model interprets to perform various tasks. Although it does not explicitly address the engineering of 'hard prefix' prompts, the systematic development of multimodal prompts for robot manipulation is a significant contribution to prompt engineering research. The study's relevance is slightly lessened only due to the lack of a specific focus on 'hard prefix' prompts, which the original query stipulates."

Since prompt engineering is integral to this research, with the effectiveness of various prompts being directly assessed and compared, it shows high relevance to the field of prompt engineering. However, it does not focus solely on 'hard prefix prompts' specifically, which may be a more nuanced subtopic within prompt engineering. Therefore, the relevance rating is not a full 10."
prompt tuning gpt-2 language model for parameter-efficient domain adaptation of asr systems,8,"The abstract discusses the use of 'domain-prompts,' which seems to be a technique closely related to prompt engineering, as it involves training domain-specific embeddings to adapt a language model to new domains. This method resembles hard prompt tuning where prompts are fixed and designed to prime the model for a specific task or domain. The study's relevance is high for prompt engineering research, particularly within the context of ASR systems and parameter-efficient adaptations. However, it doesn't discuss 'hard prefix prompts' specifically; it mentions 'domain-prompts' which may or may not be exactly the same concept. Hence, the rating is not a full 10, reflecting this small uncertainty."
chinese asr and ner improvement based on whisper fine-tuning,7,"The abstract indicates that the paper explores how to fine-tune Chinese ASR and NER tasks using Whisper, touching on the aspect of designing different prompts for various generative tasks, which is closely related to prompt engineering. While the main focus seems to be on improving ASR and NER performance, the inclusion of prompt design as a part of the fine-tuning process makes it relevant to the study of prompt engineering. However, the mention of prompts is not the central focus of the paper, which suggests that although prompt engineering is covered, it is not the primary subject matter, hence the rating of 7."
prompt generation networks for input-based adaptation of frozen vision transformers,9,"The abstract describes a novel approach to adapt frozen vision transformers via visual prompt learning, which is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it deals with generating and optimizing prompts that can be input-dependent. Although the study focuses on the visual domain, the techniques and concepts of prompt generation, learning, and the mentioned 'prompt inversion' trick are applicable and insightful for prompt engineering for different modalities. It achieves adaptation without modifying the model and is part of the broader discussion on how to efficiently use large-scale models, a significant aspect of prompt engineering. The relevance is slightly less than perfect because the specific focus on vision transformers and input-dependent prompts may not cover the entire scope of hard prefix prompts directly, but the principles are closely related."
optimizing language models for argumentative reasoning,8,"The provided abstract details an investigation into optimizing a language model for argumentative reasoning tasks, which includes an evaluation of different optimization strategies such as prompt programming. Prompt engineering, which refers to the design and usage of prompts to guide language models, is closely related to the study's focus on prompt programming as one of the optimization strategies. Although the term 'hard prefix prompts' is not explicitly mentioned, prompt programming is a technique that often involves the use of hardcoded prompts (which could be considered 'hard prefix prompts') to direct a model's output. Therefore, this study is highly relevant to the broader field of prompt engineering; however, the relevance is slightly lower as the study does not solely concentrate on hard prefix prompts but also considers other optimization strategies."

The focus on one-stage elicitation techniques, the influence of different prompting strategies such as zero-shot learning, task specification, and the exploration of hard prefix prompts (detailed in the mention of the textual context, number of examples, and label definitions) are highly relevant to prompt engineering. Although it doesn't exclusively concentrate on 'hard prefix prompts,' the exploration and systematic review of prompting strategies contributing to performance improvement are central to prompt engineering. The slight deduction in the rating acknowledges that the study is about prompt engineering as a whole rather than solely on 'hard prefix prompts.'"
efficient domain adaptation of language models in asr systems using prompt-tuning,8,"The abstract presents research on using prompt-tuning, a form of prompt engineering, for domain adaptation in ASR systems. Although the focus is on ASR systems and not specifically on 'hard prefix prompts', prompt-tuning is related to prompt engineering studies. The research seems to involve adapting language models to specific domains using prompts, which is a core aspect of prompt engineering. The methodology could be highly relevant to those interested in tailoring LMs for specific applications without the costs associated with maintaining multiple domain-specific models. However, it falls short of a perfect score because it does not address hard prefix prompts specifically, but rather the broader application of prompt-tuning for domain adaptation."

However, the term 'hard prefix prompts' is not mentioned, suggesting that while the study is within the domain of prompting (visual prompts in this case), it may not directly address the particular area of 'hard prefix prompts'. Therefore, the relevance is notable but not complete, hence a rating of 7."
motif-based prompt learning for universal cross-domain recommendation,7,"The abstract describes a motif-based prompt learning framework aimed at enhancing cross-domain recommendation systems. Although the study focuses primarily on recommendations, the use of 'motif-based prompt learning' relates closely to prompt engineering, especially in the context of adapting machine learning models to respond to different kinds of data inputs or prompts. Prompt engineering is about designing prompts that help models perform better on specific tasks. The paper's mention of 'adaptable prompt parameters' and the integration of these into pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms indicates that it deals with adjusting how models interact with prompts. However, it does not strictly focus on 'hard prefix prompts' as the study prompt requests, thus the relevance rating is not a full 10."

hetgpt: harnessing the power of prompt tuning in pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural networks,7,"While the title and abstract describe a study related to prompt engineering, the context differs from what's typically associated with 'hard prefix prompts' in prompt engineering study, which is usually referenced in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here, the concept of 'prompting' is being applied to the domain of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) and their pre-training routines. Although it does deal with prompts in an abstract sense, and may be relevant to the broader discussion on the utility of prompt-like methods in AI model training, it is not specifically about prompt engineering in the context of language models or text-based neural networks. Therefore, it is tangentially relevant, hence the rating of 7."
virtual node tuning for few-shot node classification,7,"The abstract discusses 'Virtual Node Tuning (VNT),' which involves injecting virtual nodes as 'soft prompts' in the embedding space that can be optimized for few-shot node classification tasks. While this does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' it does pertain to the usage of prompts (in this case, soft ones) in the context of machine learning. The technique is a form of prompt engineering but applied within a graph representation learning task rather than natural language processing. This alternative application of prompts in a learning framework is relevant to the broader field of prompt engineering as it provides insight into how prompts can be used to improve performance in tasks with limited labeled data. However, its relevance is somewhat indirect since it does not address hard prefix prompts explicitly or delve into systematic reviews of prompt engineering, thus the rating of 7."
pcbert: parent and child bert for chinese few-shot ner,8,"The abstract talks about 'prompt-tuning', which is a method within prompt engineering, that is being applied for Chinese few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER). While the specific term 'hard prefix prompts' is not mentioned, the concept of prompt-based techniques, which are at the heart of prompt engineering, is central to the study described in the paper.

can large language models explain themselves? a study of llm-generated self-explanations,8,"The abstract addresses the concept of 'self-explanations' generated by LLMs like ChatGPT, which directly pertains to one aspect of prompt engineering—eliciting detailed and insightful explanations from the model. Even though the abstract does not explicitly mention 'hard prefix prompts,' it discusses the broader area of how to effectively prompt LLMs for specific types of outputs, in this case, self-explanations. Since the study contributes to the understanding of how LLMs can be guided to provide explanations, it is relevant to the study of prompt engineering. However, the rating is not a full 10 because the abstract does not focus specifically on hard prefix prompts but rather on the general capability of LLMs to explain their reasoning."
learning profitable nft image diffusions via multiple visual-policy guided reinforcement learning,7,"The study focuses on generating Non-Fungible Token (NFT) images using a combination of language and image generation models, which relates to prompt engineering in that it involves generating detailed prompts to create specific visual attributes in NFTs. The use of a large language model (LLM) to enhance human input into more complex prompts is particularly relevant to prompt engineering. However, the study also diverges into optimization metrics and market value considerations, aspects that are less directly connected to traditional prompt engineering. Hence, the rating acknowledges the relevance of prompt generation and refinement while noting that not all aspects of the paper are centered on prompt engineering."

This involves understanding how prompting affects LLM behavior and assessing the models' reliability, which is a core aspect of prompt engineering. The use of prompting chaining is directly related to the design and engineering of prompts that can manipulate or test the behavior of LLMs. Although the study's focus is on hallucination and the generation of evaluation data, the methods used are a part of prompt engineering practices."
improving few-shot generalization of safety classifiers via data augmented parameter-efficient fine-tuning,8,"The study is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it explores the use of prompt-tuning (a form of prompt engineering) combined with data augmentation to improve the performance of language models on safety classification tasks. This work directly pertains to the field of prompt engineering, as it aims to enhance model generalization using techniques that modify the input prompt structure to better guide the model in few-shot learning scenarios. The approach mentioned, similarity-based data-augmentation + prompt-tuning (DAPT), is a specific instance of prompt engineering, thus making the study quite relevant. Despite the focus on domain-generalized few-shot learning for safety applications and not solely on 'hard prefix prompts', the paper’s exploration of prompt-tuning in practice warrants a high relevance score."
tempera: test-time prompt editing via reinforcement learning,9,"The paper's abstract indicates that the work is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it presents a novel method (TEMPERA) which focuses on editing prompts using reinforcement learning. This directly aligns with innovations and advancements in prompt design strategies for large language models, which is at the heart of prompt engineering studies.

However, the contributions to optimizing prompts and improving sample efficiency are very pertinent to the field."
can llms keep a secret? testing privacy implications of language models via contextual integrity theory,7,"The study discusses the implications of information handling by large language models (LLMs), which relates to how these models process and output information based on the instructions (prompts) they receive. While it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' it touches on the broader topic of prompt design and its influence on model behavior, particularly regarding privacy. It is relevant to prompt engineering since understanding and improving the privacy reasoning capabilities of LLMs can lead to the development of better prompts that protect user privacy. The rating is not a perfect 10 because the study's focus is on privacy and not explicitly on the structure or format of the prompts themselves, which would be a central aspect of a study dedicated entirely to prompt engineering."
using global land cover product as prompt for cropland mapping via visual foundation model,7,"The abstract discusses leveraging the 'Pretrain+Prompting' paradigm, which is relevant to prompt engineering as it involves designing prompts to aid in domain adaptation for cropland mapping. The introduction of the auto-prompting (APT) method aligns with prompt engineering by using prompts to modify the behavior of pre-trained models on specific tasks. However, the direct focus on cropland mapping and the use of visual foundation models means it is not exclusively centered on prompt engineering but rather its application in a specific domain. Thus, it is moderately relevant but not a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts."
tailoring personality traits in large language models via unsupervisedly-built personalized lexicons,7,"The study described in the abstract addresses the manipulation of language models' outputs by tailoring personality traits, which is related to prompt engineering in the sense that it involves guiding the language model to generate text with certain characteristics.

cross-domain reasoning via template filling,8,"The paper discusses a prompt-template-filling approach which is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering as it directly involves designing prompts to facilitate cross-domain reasoning in sequence to sequence models. The relevance is slightly lower than the maximum score because the prompt engineering study specified involves hard prefix prompts, and it is not clear from the abstract if the study specifically addresses hard prefix prompts or if it has a broader scope. Nevertheless, the methodology and case studies presented are likely to be informative for prompt engineering research, particularly in understanding and improving model's abilities in cross-domain applications."
stprompt: semantic-guided and task-driven prompts for effective few-shot classification,9,"The given title and abstract describe an approach to prompt engineering that is specifically tailored to improve few-shot classification performance in language models. The development of the STPrompt model, which utilizes semantic-guided and task-driven prompts, is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering. The use of prompts that are constructed from semantic dependency trees and task-specific metadata is indicative of advanced prompt engineering techniques. Therefore, the study is almost directly aligned with prompt engineering, with the potential deduction of a point for not addressing 'hard prefix prompts' as the prompt is open-ended regarding the type of prompts studied."
supplementary material for mask-free ovis: open-vocabulary instance segmentation without manual mask annotations,8,"The abstract describes a process of using prompt templates to generate pseudo-captions from image-labels for vision-language models. This is highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering because it involves the creation of templates that structure input for language models in a way that improves their understanding and output generation. While it doesn't directly mention the term 'hard prefix prompts', the use of rigidly structured prompt templates hints at a similar concept. Prompt engineering is crucial in this context to ensure that the model correctly interprets the image categories and generates coherent and accurate captions. The rating isn't a full 10 as it doesn't cover the entire breadth of prompt engineering studies, especially those that pertain to non-image related tasks, but it remains significantly relevant for the subset of prompt engineering it pertains to."
pre-training extractive question-answer prompts for few-shot chinese text classiﬁcation,8,"The document discusses the use of prompt learning for few-shot text classification, which is a subset of prompt engineering as it involves designing and training prompts to work effectively with pre-trained language models. The relevance to prompt engineering is high because it directly deals with the creation of prompts that fit a specific task, which is extractive question-answering in this case. The study also touches upon improving the efficiency of such prompts using contrastive learning, which is an advanced topic in prompt engineering. However, the specific term 'hard prefix prompts' is not mentioned, which suggests that while the document is highly relevant to prompt engineering, it may not cover the 'hard prefix' aspect explicitly."
grounding language to entities and dynamics for generalization in reinforcement learning,7,"The described study involves creating templates for textual descriptions and has a component of paraphrasing, which relates to prompt engineering in that it deals with the systematic construction and variation of prompts. However, because it is situated within the context of reinforcement learning and generalization rather than directly focused on prompt engineering for language models or search queries, it is not a perfect match for the specific topic of a 'hard prefix prompts' systematic review."
