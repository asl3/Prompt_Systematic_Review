It focuses on tuning prompts as a parameter-efficient way to adjust model representation to new data domains. Although the term 'prompt' in the context of this paper refers to visual prompts in a vision Transformer, which differs from textual prompts commonly discussed in NLP prompt engineering, the concept of adjusting a small set of parameters for domain adaptation is aligned with the principles of prompt engineering. The reason for not being a 10 is that the term 'hard prefix prompts' was not mentioned, which suggests that the exact topic of the prompt may not be covered in its entirety."
repository-level prompt generation for large language models of code,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The paper presents a framework that directly contributes to the field of prompt engineering by generating example-specific prompts for large language models of code. The fact that this system uses the context of the entire repository and does not rely on the internal weights of the models aligns well with the principles of prompt engineering, where context and relevance are crucial for effective prompt design. The relevance to engineering study is slightly less than perfect only because it is specific to code generation and not the broader application of prompts in general large language models."

This approach aligns with the practice of designing prompts to effectively elicit desired responses from pre-trained models, which is central to prompt engineering. The only reason it doesn't receive a full 10 is because the paper is specifically about the domain of graph data and might not cover other aspects or generalities of prompt engineering."
visual prompt tuning for generative transfer learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The provided abstract discusses the topic of prompt tuning which is relevant to prompt engineering, a field that deals with optimizing the input given to AI models to elicit better performance. Although the context of the abstract is specific to the domain of generative image models and visual prompts, which is slightly different from hard prefix prompts in textual domain, the general principles and techniques of prompt tuning can be considered applicable across multiple domains. Hence, the content is substantially relevant to prompt engineering, especially in demonstrating knowledge transfer and domain adaptation which are significant challenges in the field. The lower rating reflects the domain-specific focus on visual transformers rather than a general treatment of all forms of prompt engineering."
prompt vision transformer for domain generalization,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract describes a study that involves prompt learning with vision transformers for the purpose of domain generalization. Although the study does not specifically mention 'hard prefix prompts', it does focus on a prompt-based method (DoPrompt) for improving the performance of ViTs in unseen domains. This is relevant to prompt engineering because it is a direct application of using prompts to enhance model generalization. The relevance rating is not a full 10 because the study does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' as specified in the initial prompt, but it is closely related and contributes to the field of prompt engineering."

Thus, the paper contributes valuable insights to the broader field of prompt engineering, even if it is not specialized in hard prefix prompts specifically. The rating is not a full 10 due to the abstract's lack of direct reference to hard prefix prompts."
incremental prompting: episodic memory prompt for lifelong event detection,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The presented abstract is relevant to prompt engineering study to a considerable extent because it introduces 'Episodic Memory Prompts (EMP)', which is a technique relevant to prompt engineering. It contributes to the field by addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting and suggesting a prompt-based method to retain task-specific knowledge in a model that is being continually updated. This is pertinent as it deals with prompt optimization and its role in lifelong learning, both of which fall under the broad umbrella of prompt engineering. However, it is not a 'systematic review on hard prefix prompts' specifically; rather, it is an empirical study about a novel approach to prompting. Hence, the rating is not a full 10, as it does not exactly match the premise of a 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts.'"
prompt-matched semantic segmentation,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"While the abstract discusses 'prompt learning' in the context of visual foundation models and semantic segmentation, which is somewhat related to the concept of 'prompt engineering,' it refers to a different domain (visual tasks rather than text-based tasks). The relevance to prompt engineering studies is indirect, as the principles of learning prompts for tasks could potentially be analogous across domains. However, the term 'prompt' in this context does not directly correspond to 'hard prefix prompts' typically discussed in language models and prompt engineering. The methodology and application are related in a broader sense to the concept of optimizing pre-trained models using prompts, so it receives a medium-high relevance rating."

This is highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering as it presents a specific instance where prompts are engineered to bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, enhancing the model's performance on downstream tasks with few-shot or zero-shot learning. Although the study focuses specifically on vision-language models and doesn't address hard prefix prompts in general, the concept of tailoring prompts for better performance is directly applicable to the field of prompt engineering. Thus, the rating reflects its high relevance due to its innovative approach to prompt design, with some points deducted for not directly addressing the broader topic of hard prefix prompts."
differentiable prompt makes pre-trained language models better few-shot learners,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper presents a method (DART) for enhancing the few-shot learning capabilities of small language models without traditional prompt engineering. Although it claims to bypass 'any prompt engineering,' the method still inherently deals with prompts by differentially optimizing prompt templates. Therefore, it is relevant to the study of prompt engineering since it explores an alternative avenue for prompt manipulation. The rating is not a full 10 because the study appears to focus more on the model's few-shot learning improvement rather than prompting techniques themselves."
adapting language models for zero-shot learning by meta-tuning on dataset and prompt collections,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study describes a process of 'meta-tuning' pre-trained language models on a variety of datasets and unifying label descriptions in a QA format to optimize them for zero-shot learning. While not specifically addressing 'hard prefix prompts,' it heavily involves the concept of using prompts to improve the performance of language models in tasks they were not explicitly trained for. This is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering, as it explores how different methods of providing input to models (in this case, through meta-tuning) can result in better alignment with desired outcomes. The TLDR further confirms the study's relevance to prompt engineering by emphasizing the improved performance on answering prompts. However, given that it does not directly study hard prefix prompts, the rating is not a full 10."
align and prompt: video-and-language pre-training with entity prompts,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract describes a pre-training framework for video-and-language tasks, focusing on cross-modal alignment and introducing a novel prompting entity modeling concept. Although the study involves 'entity prompts,' it primarily concentrates on video-text interaction rather than exploring 'hard prefix prompts' as may be suggested by prompt engineering in a language model context. The relevance to prompt engineering is secondary and indirect, mainly connected through the novel use of prompts for entity modeling within a multimodal framework, not as a comprehensive study of prompt engineering itself."

It highlights the use of language prompts to tune pre-trained language models for specific tasks, which is an essential component of research within prompt engineering. The relevance is high because the work specifically investigates prompt-learning methodologies and their applications, including a new self-supervised strategy for zero-shot scenarios, directly contributing to the understanding and advancement of how prompts can improve model performance on a granular level. The only detail preventing a perfect score is the lack of explicit mention of 'hard prefix prompts,' but the described study is likely to have significant implications for prompt engineering in general."
a good prompt is worth millions of parameters: low-resource prompt-based learning for vision-language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract clearly pertains to the study of prompt engineering, as it discusses the utilization and effects of prompts in few-shot learning tasks for vision-language models. The research focuses on how different types of prompts (noisy versus hand-crafted) influence the learning process and performance of the model. The mention of 'prefix language modeling' also directly relates to the prompt engineering study, specifically regarding hard prefix prompts. The high score reflects the direct relevance to the study of how prompts can improve or affect the learning capabilities of AI models, despite not exclusively being about 'hard prefix prompts', hence not a perfect score."

rethinking reinforcement learning for recommendation: a prompt perspective,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The relevance to prompt engineering in this study lies in the proposed Prompt-Based Reinforcement Learning (PRL) framework for recommendations, which intersects with the field of prompt engineering by leveraging state-reward inputs as prompts during the decision-making process. The study doesn't center on prompt engineering as it typically applies to language models or processes of tuning textual inputs, but it does conceptualize a similar method within the RL context, angling prompts as essential elements in training RL models for improved recommendation systems. Therefore, its relevance is notable but not directly central to the typical application of prompt engineering, which more commonly refers to optimizing inputs for generative language models."
point prompt tuning for temporally language grounding,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract discusses 'Point Prompt Tuning (PPT)' as a novel approach that integrates prompt-based strategies within a multi-modal learning framework, specifically applied to the task of temporally language grounding (TLG) in videos.

language is not all you need: aligning perception with language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"While the provided abstract does not directly discuss 'hard prefix prompts' or 'prompt engineering,' it details the capabilities of Kosmos-1, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), which is relevant to the field of prompt engineering. The ability of Kosmos-1 to learn in context and follow instructions, including zero-shot and few-shot settings, as well as its evaluation in multimodal chain-of-thought prompting, relates closely to how prompts can be engineered and optimized to interact with language models. Moreover, the cross-modal knowledge transfer mentioned is a component of understanding how prompts can be designed to leverage language in multimodal environments. However, since the focus is primarily on the model's capabilities rather than on the study of prompts themselves, the relevance rating is not a maximal score."
improving factuality and reasoning in language models through multiagent debate,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper described is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it discusses a novel method for improving language model responses through a multiagent debate system. Although it does not specifically mention a 'hard prefix prompt', the techniques involved in creating prompts that facilitate a debate among language models are closely linked to advanced prompt engineering strategies.

are hard examples also harder to explain? a study with human and model-generated explanations,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study touches on aspects of prompting when it investigates size and hardness of the test samples and their impact on the quality of explanations generated by both humans and GPT-3. This is indirectly related to prompt engineering, as the quality of outputs generated by LLMs may depend on the prompt's difficulty level, which can inform prompt engineering strategies. However, the study's primary focus is on the explainability and the comparison of human and model-generated explanations, not specifically on engineering prompts to improve LLM performance."
prefix-tuning: optimizing continuous prompts for generation,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper discusses 'prefix-tuning,' which is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering as it involves optimizing task-specific vectors (prefixes) to improve performance on natural language generation tasks without the need to fine-tune all parameters of a language model. While the term 'hard prefix prompts' isn't explicitly used, the concept of prefix-tuning relies on a similar principle of using prompts (in this case, a trainable prefix) to guide the behavior of a language model. This is pertinent to the study of how prompts affect model performance and behavior, thus earning a high relevance rating. However, it's not a perfect match because the prompt specified a 'hard prefix prompts' review, and this paper focuses on a subset of prompt engineering that is not strictly the 'hard prefix.'"
a comprehensive survey on pretrained foundation models: a history from bert to chatgpt,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The provided abstract and TLDR are related to Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) and cover a wide range of aspects including their history, applications, and challenges across different data modalities. While prompt engineering is not directly mentioned, the study's focus on 'zero shot or few shot prompting' used by models like ChatGPT suggests an indirect relation to the topic. Thus, the paper may contain insights relevant for understanding the broader context of prompt engineering, particularly in how PFMs accommodate prompt-based interactions. However, since prompt engineering is a more specific discipline focused on the design and optimization of prompts to effectively leverage models like GPT or BERT, and the summary does not explicitly address hard prefix prompts or prompt engineering techniques, it receives a moderate rating of relevance."
segment everything everywhere all at once,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract provided describes the creation of an interactive and promptable model (SEEM) for image segmentation tasks that is inspired by the mechanism of large language models (LLMs). Since prompt engineering refers to the design and refinement of prompts to effectively interact with models, such as LLMs, the study of SEEM's novel decoding mechanism that allows for diverse prompting is relevant to the field of prompt engineering. SEEM's ability to handle different types of dynamic prompts and its focus on a joint visual-semantic space are aspects that can provide valuable insights into how prompts can be optimized for better interaction with models across various domains. The work also touches on compositionality and semantic-awareness, both of which are key concepts in prompt engineering. While the focus is on image segmentation, the principles of designing prompts for interactive and semantic tasks align closely with prompt engineering methodologies. Therefore, the relevance rating is high but not maximum because the primary application is in the domain of image segmentation rather than text-based models, which are more commonly associated with prompt engineering."

Chaining can be viewed as an advanced form of prompt engineering where prompts are not static but follow a dynamic, modular process. Although the study does not directly discuss 'hard prefix prompts,' it explores the controllability and transparency of LLMs, which are crucial aspects in designing effective prompts. The relevance rating is not a full 10 because the study's focus is on chaining mechanisms rather than the specific concept of 'hard prefix prompts.'"
craft an iron sword: dynamically generating interactive game characters by prompting large language models tuned on code,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract indicates a study that involves using example conversational prompts with a language model to enhance NPC interactions in games. While the main focus seems to be on generating natural language and code for game development purposes, the underlying premise is that these prompts are essential in directing the behavior of the language model. This relates to the subject of prompt engineering, as the quality and design of the prompts directly affect the output and capabilities of the conversational agent.

decomposed soft prompt guided fusion enhancing for compositional zero-shot learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract presents a study on a method for compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) using a framework called Decomposed Fusion with Soft Prompt (DFSP). While it is related to engineering prompts in the context of vision-language models, which indeed falls under the broader category of prompt engineering, it isn't directly focused on hard prefix prompts as mentioned in the initial request. The paper's relevance is therefore not exact but tangentially related since it involves the construction of vector combinations of learnable soft prompts, which can be considered a part of prompt engineering. However, the method described diverges from the original topic of 'hard prefix prompts,' which typically implies a non-modifiable text input for models, as opposed to the learnable prompts discussed here."

prompt-based zero-shot relation extraction with semantic knowledge augmentation,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper discusses a prompt-based model, which is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering, particularly in the context of zero-shot learning. The focus on generating prompts with semantic knowledge integration touches on a core area of how prompts can be engineered to improve task performance in natural language processing. The relevance score is not a full 10 because the study seems to emphasize the zero-shot relation extraction aspect alongside prompt engineering, rather than being exclusively focused on the methodologies for creating and optimizing prompts (i.e., hard prefix prompts). Nevertheless, the paper still offers substantial insight into the application of prompt engineering concepts."
from visual prompt learning to zero-shot transfer: mapping is all you need,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The article discusses a novel approach to adapting large-scale pre-trained models to new tasks using a technique called SeMap, which aligns semantic knowledge for visual prompt learning. The relevance to prompt engineering is high because the research deals with the optimization and creation of prompts that facilitate the use of pre-trained models in new tasks without fine-tuning (zero-shot transfer). This is closely related to the concept of hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering, where the goal is to improve the interaction with a model to produce better performance on target tasks. However, since the main focus is on visual prompt learning rather than hard prefix prompts specifically, the rating is not a full 10."

hierarchical prompt learning for compositional zero-shot recognition,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper appears to address the concept of prompt engineering by exploring hierarchical prompt learning within the context of Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). While it is not a comprehensive systematic review of hard prefix prompts as such, it does contribute to the field of prompt engineering by proposing a novel approach to learning prompts hierarchically, and is thus relevant. The use of prefixed prompts to improve the performance of a vision-language model like CLIP could be considered a form of prompt engineering. However, the rating is not a full 10 because the study is not specifically a systematic review of hard prefix prompts, which was the exact topic requested."

This development aligns with engineering prompts that can enhance model performance in specific tasks, such as OOD detection in this case. Although the emphasis is on OOD detection rather than on prompt engineering itself, the methodology is highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering techniques."
zero-shot information extraction for clinical meta-analysis using large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract describes a study that employs large language models for zero-shot prompt-based information extraction in the medical field, which is directly related to the concept of prompt engineering. The investigation of zero-shot performance implicates the design and structuring of prompts to elicit accurate information from language models without any training examples, which is a subset of prompt engineering. While the study focuses on a specialized application in clinical meta-analysis rather than a broad systematic review of hard prefix prompts, it does contribute to the overall knowledge of prompt engineering effectiveness and challenges. Therefore, the relevance is high, but not absolute given the specialized context."

Although the main focus is on reinforcement learning and the efficacy of VLMs in this context, the mention of using 'minimal prompt engineering' indicates that there is a relevance to the study of crafting prompts. However, the primary emphasis is not on the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' or the intricacies of prompt engineering methods, which would be required for a higher relevance score."
zero-shot text classification via self-supervised tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract discusses a novel approach to zero-shot text classification using self-supervised learning, which includes an alternative prompting method where the model learns to predict the first sentence of a paragraph. This is relevant to prompt engineering as it touches on the use of prompts to improve language model performance without relying on large-scale annotated data. However, the focus is more on the self-supervised learning aspect and the specific learning objective, rather than a deep dive into prompt engineering or hard prefix prompts specifically. Therefore, the relevance is moderate."
harnessing the zero-shot power of instruction-tuned large language model in end-to-end speech recognition,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract deals with the utilization of an instruction-tuned large language model within the context of ASR, which relates to prompt engineering in the sense that precise instructions are used to guide the LLM. However, the focus is more on the application of LLMs for improving ASR rather than on the study or optimization of the prompts themselves (i.e., hard prefix prompts or prompt engineering techniques). The relevance is moderate because it showcases an implementation of prompt-instructed LLMs, but it does not directly address a systematic review or study on prompt engineering."

towards realistic zero-shot classification via self structural semantic alignment,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The relevance of the text to prompt engineering is moderate to high. The paper discusses a Self Structural Semantic Alignment (S^3A) framework that involves generating discriminative prompts using large language models, which is directly related to the field of prompt engineering. The fact that the S^3A framework includes a component where prompts are generated to discern confusing candidates demonstrates the application of prompt engineering in the paper. However, the overarching goal of the paper is zero-shot classification using Vision Language Models, and prompt engineering is only one aspect of the complex methodology being proposed. The rating is not higher because the main focus is not solely on prompt engineering; instead, it's a part of a larger framework designed for a specific application in machine learning."

random word data augmentation with clip for zero-shot anomaly detection,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper presents a method that uses CLIP, a visual-language model, and involves prompt-guided classification which is clearly related to prompt engineering. Although the focus is on zero-shot anomaly detection and data augmentation, the use of prompts to guide the CLIP model's text encoder for generating data brings it within the domain of prompt engineering studies. The prompts are crucial for the generation of text embeddings which are subsequently used to train the anomaly detection model, significantly impacting the performance of the system. The paper does not focus on 'hard prefix prompts' specifically, so it may not align completely with a comprehensive review of that exact topic, but it certainly provides relevant information about prompt usage in the context of AI-powered anomaly detection."

Although the study does not specifically mention 'hard prefix prompts,' it does deeply engage with prompt engineering for zero-shot tasks in LLMs. Since prompt engineering is essential in operationalizing these models for specific tasks, and the study clearly contributes to understanding and innovating in this field, it has high relevance to prompt engineering study. However, it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' hence the rating is not a perfect 10."
reducing negative effects of the biases of language models in zero-shot setting,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper is relevant to prompt engineering as it addresses the issue of biases in language models, particularly GPTs, which is a key concern when engineering prompts for zero-shot settings. By proposing a method to reduce bias through the use of probing samples and a Calibration Adapter, the study is relevant to the prompt engineering field as it contributes to the development of more fair and balanced prompting strategies. However, the primary focus seems to be on model calibration rather than on designing or structuring prompts, hence the rating is not a perfect 10."
model-generated pretraining signals improves zero-shot generalization of text-to-text transformers,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper is relevant to prompt engineering, particularly in the exploration of training strategies that could impact how effectively models respond to prompts. Although the main focus is on zero-shot generalization of text-to-text Transformers and pretraining strategies (e.g., using model-generated signals), the fact that it includes prompt-finetuning on a mixture of NLP tasks indicates relevance. The creation of METRO-T0, which competes with state-of-the-art models on prompted NLP benchmarks, underscores the potential impact of pretraining on prompt-based tasks. However, the paper does not seem to focus specifically on 'hard prefix prompts' but rather on a broader approach to pretraining and finetuning."
interaction-aware prompting for zero-shot spatio-temporal action detection,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study describes the use of prompting as a mechanism to obtain more appropriate text features for zero-shot spatio-temporal action detection, which falls under the broader scope of prompt engineering. However, the context is very specialized and focuses more on the application to a specific domain (video processing and action detection) rather than the study of hard prefix prompts in general.

One of the two zero-shot approaches mentioned employs prompt engineering, achieving a high accuracy of 93%. The relevance to prompt engineering is high because the study specifically involves the use of prompt engineering techniques in an NER task, which is a significant part of language model application. However, the relevance is not rated as a full 10 because the abstract also describes a second approach that diverts from prompt engineering and is based on transforming the problem into a question-answering task. Therefore, while prompt engineering is a central theme, it is not the exclusive focus of the study."

While the primary focus seems to be on video generation, the role of LLMs in interpreting and directing user prompts aligns with the study of designing and improving prompts to achieve specific outcomes. The framework's ability to translate user prompts into separate and temporally consistent frame prompts demonstrates an application of prompt engineering techniques. Therefore, the approach of dissecting abstract prompts into frame-level instructions can be viewed as a form of prompt engineering. The rating is not a full 10 because the abstract does not explicitly focus on the study of prompt engineering in general but rather its application within a specific context of video generation."
sc vall-e: style-controllable zero-shot text to speech synthesizer,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The title of the study 'SC VALL-E: Style-Controllable Zero-Shot Text to Speech Synthesizer' indicates a research focus on text to speech (TTS) synthesis with style control, which is tangentially relevant to prompt engineering. Although prompt engineering typically involves refining input prompts to achieve better performance in language models, the abstract describes a system that takes text and prompt audio as input to control speech attributes like emotion and pitch. This relates to a form of prompt engineering where the prompt is not just textual but also auditory. The mention of 'tokens in the style embedding matrix' also suggests a relationship with prompt engineering as it implies the manipulation of specific elements to guide the model's output. However, the primary focus on TTS synthesis and lack of explicit discussion on prompt engineering in language models warrants a rating that isn't at the highest relevance."
language models as zero-shot trajectory generators,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the abstract discusses the usage of Large Language Models for trajectory generation in robotics, which would require careful crafting of prompts to interact with the model effectively, the focus on 'hard prefix prompts' in the context of a comprehensive systematic review is not directly addressed. Although the principles of prompt engineering could be applied to formulate the inputs for GPT-4 in this study, the abstract does not specifically mention or concentrate on 'hard prefix prompts', nor does it suggest a systematic review of such prompts. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as the concept of prompting is involved, but not specific to the requested area of study."

However, the core of the study focuses on streaming ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models and improving their latency, which is not directly related to the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' in the traditional sense of prompt engineering for language models. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as it deals with prompts in a different context than what 'prompt engineering study' might typically imply, which is often associated with text-based language model prompting."

However, the study seems to focus on a specific type of prompting (neural symbolic prompting with code), rather than a comprehensive systematic review. Hence, the rating is not a full 10, but it's still high because of the clear relevance and potential impact on the study of prompting methods."
set-of-mark prompting unleashes extraordinary visual grounding in gpt-4v,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The relevance of this study to prompt engineering lies in its methodology of using a visual prompting method (Set-of-Mark or SoM) to improve the performance of a language model with visual capabilities (GPT-4V). Although the study is focused on enhancing the visual grounding aspects of multimodal models, it does indirectly relate to the broader concept of prompt engineering by demonstrating a specific way to structure input (in this case, visual input) to achieve better performance on tasks that require understanding and interpreting visual information. Thus, the study is somewhat relevant as it expands the scope of prompt engineering into the multimodal domain, demonstrating that the structuring of prompts is important not just in text but also in how models interact with and interpret visual data."
legal syllogism prompting: teaching large language models for legal judgment prediction,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper focuses on a specific application of prompt engineering in the context of legal judgment prediction using a technique named 'legal syllogism prompting'.

The inclusion of attribute annotations and the use of a semantic retrieval component are innovative strategies within prompt engineering. This approach is relevant to prompt engineering as it directly involves manipulating and engineering prompts to improve performance on a language task. It is particularly focused on prompting in the context of large language models, which is a core area of interest in prompt engineering studies. Although the paper is focused on translation tasks, the techniques and concepts discussed may be applicable to prompt engineering in broader contexts as well."
pieclass: weakly-supervised text classification with prompting and noise-robust iterative ensemble training,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper discusses PIEClass, which includes a pseudo label acquisition module utilizing zero-shot prompting of pre-trained language models (PLMs). This is relevant to prompt engineering because it involves using prompts to facilitate text classification in the absence of extensive datasets. It shows an application of prompt engineering in enhancing understanding beyond static keyword matching, which is a core challenge in the field. The iterative ensemble training module, while interesting as an approach to classifier training, is less directly related to prompt engineering. Hence the score is an 8 instead of a perfect 10, as the relevance is strong but not exclusively focused on prompt engineering."
self-explanation prompting improves dialogue understanding in large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study focuses on a novel 'Self-Explanation' prompting strategy specifically designed to improve Large Language Models' (LLMs) understanding in task-oriented dialogues, which falls under the broader category of prompt engineering. Although it does not deal with 'hard prefix prompts' per se, the research is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering because it explores new methods for improving the performance of LLMs in processing complex dialogue contexts. The relevance rating is not a full 10 because the study is not directly about 'hard prefix prompts,' but it is significant due to its contribution to the overarching goal of optimizing prompts to enhance model comprehension."
fixed input parameterization for efficient prompting,gpt-4-1106-preview,10,"The abstract provided discusses the Fixed Input Parameterization (FIP) problem in the context of prompt engineering and how it aims to make the use of fixed prompts more efficient by integrating them into the parameters of a Language Model (LM). This is highly relevant to prompt engineering study as it tackles the optimization of prompt usage, which is a core aspect of prompt engineering in language models. The efficiency improvements and the exploration of methodologies for FIP in specific tasks such as persona-dependent conversation, semantic parsing, and zero-shot learning with task instructions offer direct insights into prompt engineering. Therefore, the content of this abstract is directly related to the field of prompt engineering, addressing both the technical and application aspects of the topic."
map: low-data regime multimodal learning with adapter-based pre-training and prompting,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study discusses the use of prompting in the context of vision-language multimodal learning, which is pertinent to prompt engineering. The focus on a moderate-size model (MAP) that leverages adapter-based pretraining and prompting for efficient transfer learning in a low-data regime demonstrates the application of prompting strategies. While the specifics of 'hard prefix prompts' are not mentioned, the concept of prompting is central to the paper, thereby making it relevant to the broader field of prompt engineering studies. However, the relevance is not maximal since the primary focus seems to be on the application of prompting within multimodal learning and not on the systematic review of the prompt engineering itself."
p5: plug-and-play persona prompting for personalized response selection,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The presented paper is highly relevant to prompt engineering due to its focus on using prompt sequences for personalized response selection in chatbots, which is a specific application of prompt engineering. The proposed method integrates the use of prompts to manage conversation flow based on persona, and it directly pertains to the engineering of prompts that help personalize chatbot responses. However, the paper is not exclusively about 'hard prefix prompts' (a term often related to the fixed instruction or text added to input data in language models to steer the response), which might have been implied in the phrase 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts' in the original prompt. The paper focuses on persona prompting, which is a subset of prompt engineering but does not represent a broad overview or systematic review of hard prefix prompts in general. Therefore, while very relevant, the rating is not a full 10."
cof-cot: enhancing large language models with coarse-to-fine chain-of-thought prompting for multi-domain nlu tasks,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The presented work introduces the Coarse-to-Fine Chain-of-Thought (CoF-CoT) approach as a form of prompt engineering which is highly relevant to the field. It focuses on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in Natural Language Understanding tasks. While the study might not directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' it proposes a novel way of structuring prompts that allow for a breakdown of tasks into multiple reasoning steps. This is inherently connected to the concept of prompt engineering, as it involves designing prompts that guide the model through a reasoning process, thus fitting well within the scope of prompt engineering studies. The reason for not rating it a 10 is because it doesn't explicitly state a focus on 'hard prefix prompts,' which the original query specified, but it is nonetheless substantially relevant."

While the study may not directly address 'hard prefix prompts', the concept of utilizing expert knowledge and context to create prompts for foundation models exhibits a component of prompt-engineering techniques. This relevance is not direct, as prompt engineering typically involves text-based language prompts for natural language models as opposed to prompts for visual anomaly detection; hence, the rating is above the midpoint but not fully aligned with the focus on prompt engineering."
2nd place winning solution for the cvpr2023 visual anomaly and novelty detection challenge: multimodal prompting for data-centric anomaly detection,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The technical report describes a methodology for zero-shot anomaly segmentation using multi-modal prompts, which falls under the broader category of prompt engineering. Multimodal prompting constitutes a form of prompt engineering as it involves designing and utilizing prompts that can effectively guide machine learning models, specifically foundation models, for particular tasks such as anomaly detection. This is relevant to prompt engineering study as it includes the formulation and application of prompts; however, the focus on 'hard prefix prompts' is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the relevance is significant but not complete in the context of a systematic review on hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering."
prompting segmentation with sound is generalizable audio-visual source localizer,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract describes the use of a novel 'encoder-prompt-decoder' paradigm which directly relates to prompt engineering, as it involves constructing Semantic-aware Audio Prompts (SAPs) to improve model performance. This approach aims to enable pre-trained models to focus on sounding objects and deal with data scarcity and varying distributions, both of which are significant concerns in prompt engineering. Although the study focuses specifically on the audio-visual domain and not directly on general prompt engineering methodologies, its innovative use of prompts to bridge the semantic gap between modalities indicates its relevance to the field of prompt engineering. Therefore, it receives a high relevance rating."
aspiro: any-shot structured parsing-error-induced reprompting for consistent data-to-text generation,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The presented abstract details a novel approach (ASPIRO) for structured data verbalization which utilizes prompt engineering techniques such as re-prompting LLMs based on parsing checks. However, the focus appears to be more on reducing parsing errors and improving data-to-text generation consistency than on the study of hard prefix prompts specifically. Therefore, it is moderately relevant to the broader topic of prompt engineering but does not focus on a 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts.'"
prompting strategies for citation classification,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper directly addresses prompt engineering by investigating the effectiveness of various prompting strategies for a specific NLP task – citation classification. This is highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering as it explores how different prompting methods can influence the performance of language models. Although it doesn't specifically mention 'hard prefix prompts', the mention of 'Fixed-prompt LM tuning' suggests it touches on the subject of static prompts, which could be related. The research's systematic approach to comparing these strategies and the inclusion of newly proposed methods indicate a substantial contribution to the understanding of how prompting affects language model performance, making it fairly relevant to the field of prompt engineering."
can large language models transform computational social science?,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The research discussed in the title clearly has implications for prompt engineering, as it talks about using Large Language Models (LLMs) for Computational Social Science (CSS) tasks. The abstract mentions 'prompting best practices,' indicating that the study likely delves into how to formulate prompts to optimize LLM performance in CSS applications. While the study might not focus exclusively on 'hard prefix prompts' but rather on a broader range of prompting techniques, the findings would still be highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering since they contribute to understanding how to effectively employ prompts in complex analysis tasks, such as CSS. The relevance is not rated as a full 10 because the study’s primary focus seems to be on broad LLM application in CSS rather than focused on prompt engineering alone."
solving challenging math word problems using gpt-4 code interpreter with code-based self-verification,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract describes a study focusing on the development of a prompting strategy (explicit code-based self-verification) to enhance the performance of the GPT-4 Code Interpreter in solving math problems. Although this study is centered on prompting methods, it is specifically tailored to mathematical reasoning and involves verification of the model's output. It is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering in that it presents a novel approach to using prompts to improve the accuracy of a language model's responses. The reason for not giving a full score of 10 is that the study is particularly focused on math word problems, which is just one aspect of prompt engineering."
a fine-grained comparison of pragmatic language understanding in humans and language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study addresses a comparison of pragmatic language understanding in both humans and language models, which indirectly relates to prompt engineering since the effectiveness of prompts can be influenced by a model's ability to deal with pragmatics and non-literal meanings. However, the study does not focus specifically on prompt engineering or on the design, structure, or optimization of prompts ('hard prefix prompts'), therefore the relevance is not direct and merits a mid-range rating."
knowledge-in-context: towards knowledgeable semi-parametric language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the discussed paper presents a novel semi-parametric language model architecture that is closely related to enhancing the performance of language models, it does not directly address prompt engineering, especially with regards to 'hard prefix prompts.' The architecture indeed involves prompting in the broader sense, as it uses prompts to generate output answers, but the main focus of the study lies in knowledge integration and model efficiency, rather than on the design or study of prompts themselves. Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering is somewhat tangential and not the central theme of the paper."
learning to decompose visual features with latent textual prompts,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract provided discusses an innovation in prompt engineering, specifically within the domain of vision-language models. The study introduces Decomposed Feature Prompting (DeFo), which utilizes textual prompts as part of the learning process, aligning with the concept of prompt engineering. The relevance to prompt engineering is high because it directly involves the use of textual inputs to improve the feature extraction in a dual-model architecture. However, it does not address 'hard prefix prompts' specifically, which suggests that the content is more general in the realm of prompt engineering rather than focused on a comprehensive systematic review of hard prefix prompts."
xricl: cross-lingual retrieval-augmented in-context learning for cross-lingual text-to-sql semantic parsing,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract describes a system (XRICL) that involves constructing prompts to improve cross-lingual Text-to-SQL semantic parsing, which is relevant to the field of prompt engineering as it deals with the creation and optimization of prompts for language models. However, the focus on retrieval-augmented in-context learning and the cross-lingual aspect means it is not entirely centered on 'hard prefix prompts,' which suggests a subset of prompt engineering focusing on rigid or inflexible prompts. The study still contributes valuable insights to the broader domain of prompt engineering, hence the moderately high relevance rating."
multidimensional evaluation for text style transfer using chatgpt,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper's relevance to prompt engineering study is moderate to high because it investigates the use of ChatGPT as an evaluator for text style transfer, which involves prompt engineering to some extent. Getting ChatGPT to perform a zero-shot evaluation entails designing prompts that effectively convey the evaluation task to the model. Therefore, the study indirectly contributes to understanding how different prompts affect the performance of large language models in generating or evaluating stylized text. However, the paper primarily focuses on the application of ChatGPT as an evaluator and correlates its performance with human judgments, rather than explicitly studying the hard prefix prompts or the mechanics of prompt construction, hence the rating is not a full 10."
yes but.. can chatgpt identify entities in historical documents?,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract indicates that the study explores ChatGPT's ability to recognize entities within historical documents, specifically addressing the specificity of prompting, which is an integral aspect of prompt engineering. Although the core focus seems to be on entity recognition and classification, the mention of 'the specificity of prompting' suggests that the study does delve into how different prompts affect ChatGPT's performance in a task relevant to natural language processing. Therefore, while it is not entirely focused on 'prompt engineering' as a primary subject area, it is relevant due to its examination of prompts' effectiveness, which is a significant component of prompt engineering studies."
chain of thought prompt tuning in vision language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The document discusses 'chain of thought prompt tuning in vision language models,' which is a specific method within prompt engineering that aims at improving the reasoning process of AI models in image-related tasks. While the topic is closely related to the concept of prompt engineering, it is more narrowly focused on vision-language models and does not directly touch on 'hard prefix prompts' which seems to be the focus of the initial inquiry. The relevance is rated as 7 since the technique of chain of thought prompting falls under the wider umbrella of prompt engineering strategies and contributes to the field, even if it is not a direct study on hard prefix prompts."
speechx: neural codec language model as a versatile speech transformer,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"While the abstract does discuss the use of audio-text prompts for speech generation and how SpeechX leverage task-dependent prompting for various speech tasks, it does not specifically address hard prefix prompts in the context of prompt engineering within the text generation domain, which is generally implied by prompt engineering. There is relevance to prompts and task-dependent prompting, but not directly to the study of hard prefix prompts in a systematic review sense, hence the intermediate score."
is chatgpt a good personality recognizer? a preliminary study,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it involves evaluating ChatGPT's abilities in a specific natural language processing task using various prompting strategies, including the 'level-oriented' strategy, which is a type of hard prompt engineering tailored to guide the AI's reasoning. Although the primary focus is on personality recognition, the methodology and implications of different prompting strategies, including zero-shot chain-of-thought, directly contribute to the knowledge and optimization of prompt engineering. Hence, the relevance rating is high but not maximum, as the study does not exclusively concentrate on prompt engineering but also includes the application of the derived prompts in various downstream tasks."
let's do a thought experiment: using counterfactuals to improve moral reasoning,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The provided abstract discusses a new prompting framework, 'Thought Experiments,' which involves the engineering of prompts to teach language models improved moral reasoning using counterfactuals. While the study itself is not directly focused on 'hard prefix prompts,' it is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering, as it explores the design of specialized prompts to enhance the performance of language models in a specific type of reasoning task. Therefore, the relevance is quite high for those interested in the broader topic of how different prompting approaches can impact model performance. However, it doesn't address 'hard prefix prompts' explicitly, hence the rating is not a perfect 10."
symbolic math reasoning with language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract provided discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3 for solving math word problems and explores their reasoning capabilities. Although the primary focus is on these models' ability to solve mathematical problems symbolically and numerically, it does mention the role of specific prompting techniques and their influence on the model's problem-solving process. Therefore, while the abstract is not directly focused on a review of 'hard prefix prompts,' it does pertain to prompt engineering in the broader context of eliciting reasoning and explanations from a language model. This justifies a moderate-to-high relevance rating, as the paper could potentially contribute valuable insights into the efficacy of prompting strategies in complex problem-solving tasks with language models."
instructexcel: a benchmark for natural language instruction in excel,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The provided abstract describes a study involving the creation of a benchmark for assessing Large Language Models' (LLMs) capability to interpret natural language instructions and generate Excel-related code. This directly relates to the field of prompt engineering, as it concerns the design and testing of prompts that efficiently guide a language model to perform domain-specific tasks. However, the study does not explicitly mention 'hard prefix prompts' or a 'systematic review' of such prompts, but rather it is an example of applied prompt engineering in a practical, task-oriented context. Therefore, the relevance is high but not absolute, hence a rating of 7."
an investigation of llms' inefficacy in understanding converse relations,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The abstract presents a study on how LLMs process and understand converse relations, which relates to their semantic understanding capabilities. While this does touch on the issue of understanding structured semantics and could have indirect implications for prompt engineering (e.g., designing prompts that account for the converse relations might improve LLMs' performance), the study is not directly focused on prompt engineering or the effectiveness of hard prefix prompts. Thus, the relevance is moderate as the findings might inform prompt engineering strategies indirectly, but it is not the central theme of the study."
zero-shot generalization in dialog state tracking through generative question answering,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract discusses the use of a generative question-answering framework with a conditional language model for improving dialog state tracking, which indirectly relates to prompt engineering in that it deals with the generation of language model queries (which can be considered as prompts) for unseen constraints and slots. The system is designed to interpret natural language queries, akin to how prompts are used to extract information from language models. However, the specific focus of the study is not on prompt engineering itself or on the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts', but rather on the application of a generative language model to dialog systems for zero-shot adaptation. Therefore, while the study is relevant to the general field of language model applications (and thus has some relevance to prompt engineering), it does not directly address the subject of prompt engineering in relation to hard prefix prompts."
improving zero-shot generalization and robustness of multi-modal models,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it explicitly addresses the issue of improving the performance of multi-modal models by refining how text prompts are used. The research investigates how ambiguity in text prompts can lead to a performance gap in zero-shot tasks and proposes a methodology to enhance the accuracy by leveraging semantic label hierarchies in prompts. While the study does not focus on 'hard prefix prompts' per se, it does contribute to the overall understanding of how prompt design influences model predictions, making it relevant to the field of prompt engineering."
enhancing cross-lingual natural language inference by soft prompting with language-independent knowledge,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract discusses 'Soft prompt learning framework' and its application in cross-lingual natural language inference, which is relevant to prompt engineering as it deals with a form of prompts—soft prompts. Although it does not specifically address 'hard prefix prompts,' which the original prompt inquires about, the study of soft prompts is related and contributes to the broader field of prompt engineering. It would be more relevant if the specifics of 'hard prefix prompts' were examined, therefore it doesn't receive a full score."
precise zero-shot dense retrieval without relevance labels,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The relevance to prompt engineering is fairly high, as the abstract describes a process where a language model is prompted to generate a hypothetical document in a zero-shot context, which is clearly a form of prompt engineering. However, the focus of the study seems to be more on dense retrieval and encoding relevance rather than on the detailed study of prompt engineering or the effects of different prompting techniques. Thus, while relevant, the study may not be addressing prompt engineering in a direct or comprehensive manner as a primary focus."
seqzero: few-shot compositional semantic parsing with sequential prompts and zero-shot models,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper presents a novel approach in few-shot learning and semantic parsing, which directly relates to improving the performance of language models with limited data. Prompt engineering is an aspect of tuning language models to better interpret and respond to prompts. Since SeqZero involves creating sequential prompts that aid in generating outputs for sub-problems in semantic parsing, this study is relevant to prompt engineering as it pertains to the construction and optimization of prompts for improved model performance. However, the study's primary focus is not on the prompt engineering process itself, but rather on how prompts are utilized within a specific application of semantic parsing to achieve state-of-the-art results. Therefore, it is relevant, but not exclusively focused on the prompt engineering aspect."
from images to textual prompts: zero-shot visual question answering with frozen large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract describes a method (Img2LLM) involving the generation of prompts that effectively allow large language models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. This is highly relevant to prompt engineering because Img2LLM essentially acts as a prompt engineering tool, transforming image content into textual prompts that enable LLMs to understand and respond to visual data without the need for end-to-end training. It directly involves the design and application of effective prompts to improve the utility of LLMs in a cross-modality context. The only reason it does not receive a full 10 rating is because it specifically pertains to visual data and VQA, whereas prompt engineering can also encompass other forms of data and tasks."
rethinking the role of demonstrations: what makes in-context learning work?,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The presented paper is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it delves into the mechanics of in-context learning, which is a core aspect of prompt engineering for large language models. Understanding the role of demonstrations and the impact of various aspects of those demonstrations informs how prompts should be designed. While the paper does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' it does explore the components of demonstrations that influence a model's performance, which can be directly applied to the design and optimization of prompts (including hard prefixes) to improve model behavior. Therefore, the findings of this study are important for advancing the science of prompt engineering, though not exclusively focused on 'hard prefix prompts.'"
a survey for in-context learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The survey deals with in-context learning (ICL), which is closely related to prompt engineering, as ICL often involves using prompts to deliver the training examples to language models. Although hard prefix prompts, which are more specific in their constructions, are not mentioned explicitly, prompting strategies in general are an integral part of ICL. The survey's focus on the broader aspects of prompting strategies makes it relevant to the field of prompt engineering. However, a more direct discussion on hard prefix prompts would be required to make the paper fully applicable to a comprehensive systematic review on that specific topic."
transformers as algorithms: generalization and stability in in-context learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study examines in-context learning and generalization in transformer models, which is relevant to prompt engineering as it relates to how these models use input prompts to infer outputs. However, the focus on 'hard prefix prompts' is not specifically addressed, meaning the study might offer insights related to prompt engineering more broadly rather than hard prefix prompts in particular. Therefore, the relevance is moderate."
differentially private in-context learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study touches on the deployment of large language models (LLMs) and their adaptation to new tasks, which relates to prompt engineering in the broader sense of preparing LMs for specific applications. However, the focus is primarily on maintaining privacy via Differentially Private In-context Learning (DP-ICL), and not on the prompt engineering techniques such as 'hard prefix prompts'. Although prompt engineering may rely on data privacy principles when integrating private data, the abstract lacks a direct mention or analysis of 'hard prefix prompts', yielding a moderate relevance score."
what can transformers learn in-context? a case study of simple function classes,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract discusses 'in-context learning' which is a key aspect of prompt engineering as it deals with the ability of models to learn from the information provided in a prompt. The study's focus on how transformers can learn from in-context examples to perform tasks is relevant to understanding and improving prompt-based learning mechanisms, albeit it focuses more specifically on function classes rather than hard prefix prompts. It does not directly address prompt engineering as a systematic review but is certainly related to the broader category of how models respond to prompts. Therefore, it receives a high but not maximum relevance score."

swectrl-mini: a data-transparent transformer-based large language model for controllable text generation in swedish,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The relevance to prompt engineering study is high because the abstract describes the 'SweCTRL-Mini' model, which utilizes special tokens in generation prompts to control the genre of the generated text. This capability is directly related to prompt engineering, where prefixes or special tokens are crafted to steer the output of language models. While the abstract does not specifically focus on a 'systematic review on hard prefix prompts,' it does highlight the use of controlled prompts which is a significant aspect of prompt engineering. Therefore, the rating is slightly lowered because the paper does not explicitly cover a systematic review but is substantially related to the concept of hard prompts in controlling text generation."
reward modeling for mitigating toxicity in transformer-based language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the study focuses on mitigating toxicity in language models, which is related to improving AI behavior and output quality, it is tangential to the specific topic of 'prompt engineering', particularly 'hard prefix prompts'. Prompt engineering involves crafting inputs to guide AI models more effectively, whereas this study seems centered on a method (Reinforce-Detoxify) for reducing toxicity. Although related, it is not a direct study of prompt engineering techniques, thus the moderate rating reflects this indirect relevance."
optimizing continuous prompts for visual relationship detection by affix-tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"This abstract details a novel method involving affix-tuning transformers for optimizing visual relationship detection. While it does not explicitly use the term 'hard prefix prompts,' it does discuss the concept of 'affix-tuning,' which could be seen as a form of prompt engineering where a 'continuous task-specific vector' is optimized. This is somewhat relevant to prompt engineering as it relates to the training and utilization of model parameters in a task-specific manner. The approach of using 'prompt template' also indicates work in the direction of designing inputs that can influence model behavior, which is central to prompt engineering. However, the main focus appears to be on visual relationship detection rather than on the study or characterization of prompts (textual) in NLP tasks, hence not a perfect fit, but still relevant."
contextual transformer for offline meta reinforcement learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The presented abstract is relevant to prompt engineering as it discusses the use of prompts to improve sequence modeling-based offline reinforcement learning algorithms. The concept of prompt tuning is central to the study, and the introduction of the Contextual Meta Transformer (CMT) shows an innovative application of prompts in guiding the model towards desired outcomes and improving generalization on unseen tasks. The relevance is high since prompt engineering is explicitly mentioned and is a key part of the methodology. However, it focuses specifically on RL contexts and may not cover other aspects or domains of prompt engineering, hence the rating is not a full 10."
context-based narrative generation transformer (ngen-transformer),gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a text generation model, the NGen-Transformer, which is relevant to natural language processing and prompt engineering to some extent. It emphasizes the context assimilation capabilities of the architecture, which aligns with the concept of prompt engineering as it involves providing context or prompts for generating text. Although the paper appears to focus more on the model's architecture for story generation rather than on the systematic study of hard prefix prompts, the use of prompts (in the form of user-defined context) and performance evaluation on a prompt-based dataset (WritingPrompts) makes it moderately relevant to prompt engineering studies."
chinese text paraphrase recognition based on openprompt introducing hybrid prompts,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract discusses the use of hybrid prompts, which are directly related to prompt engineering, offering a method to enhance the knowledge extraction from pretrained language models for paraphrase recognition tasks. It demonstrates a practical application of prompt engineering in the form of OpenPrompt and hybrid prompts, providing relevant outcomes like the improvement in F1 score and accuracy when using such prompts. This study helps in understanding prompt-based methods, hence the high relevance rating to prompt engineering. Only a full read-through could confirm if it tackles 'hard prefix prompts' specifically, but the mention of hybrid prompts with [mask] slots strongly suggests relevance to the field of prompt engineering."
fp-detr: detection transformer advanced,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The paper 'fp-detr: detection transformer advanced' mentions the use of a concept analogous to prompts in NLP, where query positional embeddings serve as 'visual prompts' to assist in object detection. While this indicates a potential crossover concept with prompt engineering, it's specific to the visual domain rather than the textual domain typically associated with prompt engineering in NLP studies. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as it offers insight into how the idea of prompts can be applied in different contexts, but it does not address hard prefix prompts or their systematic review in NLP applications specifically."
learning to compress prompts with gist tokens,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract describes a method directly related to prompt engineering, focusing on the efficiency of using prompts with language models. The introduction of 'gisting' to compress prompts into 'gist' tokens falls within the field of prompt engineering as it aims to optimize the use of prompts in terms of computational resources. The mentioned benefits, such as compute efficiency, compression ratios, and minimal loss in output quality, are highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering. The relevance is not rated as a perfect 10 because the specific context of 'hard prefix prompts' is not directly addressed, but the overall subject is still substantially pertinent to the field."
zero-shot entity and tweet characterization with designed conditional prompts and contexts,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it involves the use of 'hard prefix prompts' which are a form of prompt construction. It explores the capabilities of GPT-2 in zero-shot settings, which is an important aspect of prompt engineering, particularly when it comes to designing prompts that guide the model to perform specific tasks without prior task-specific training. The focus on human psychology-inspired and logical conditional prefixes is directly related to engineering prompts to produce desired outputs. However, the research is not exclusively focused on the systematic review of hard prefix prompts but rather on the application of these prompts for a specific task, which is why it does not receive a full score."
instruction-vit: multi-modal prompts for instruction learning in vit,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper presents an application of prompt engineering in the context of visual transformers, focusing on multi-modal prompts for instruction learning, which is highly relevant to prompt engineering. Although it primarily discusses visual transformer models and their application to image classification tasks, the concept of using text or image prompts to improve model performance is directly connected to the field of prompt engineering. The review on 'hard prefix prompts' might have a different focus compared to multi-modal prompts in visual transformers, but both share the overarching theme of enhancing model capabilities through prompts. Hence, the relevance is high, although not exact, hence not a perfect score of 10."
clinical decision transformer: intended treatment recommendation through goal prompting,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The relevance of the study titled 'clinical decision transformer: intended treatment recommendation through goal prompting' to prompt engineering is moderately high. The concept of 'goal prompting' directly connects to the practice of designing prompts to achieve specific outputs in a natural language processing context. Although this paper is primarily focused on a medical application, the technique of formulating prompts to guide the decision-making output of an AI model is a key aspect of prompt engineering. The concept could potentially be applied to other areas in AI where prompt design is crucial. However, the specificity to clinical recommendations and the absence of a direct focus on hard prefix prompts or a broad range of prompt engineering applications slightly reduce its overall relevance."
adversarial transformer language models for contextual commonsense inference,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper discusses the use of both hard prompts (specific words) and soft prompts (virtual learnable templates) in the context of language model prompting to control the generation of commonsense assertions, which is directly related to prompt engineering. Although the paper's primary focus is on commonsense inference, the technique of 'hinting' as described involves engineering prompts to guide the language model, which is relevant to the study of prompt engineering."
"tryage: real-time, intelligent routing of user prompts to large language models",gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the described paper, 'tryage: real-time, intelligent routing of user prompts to large language models,' indirectly relates to the field of prompt engineering by addressing optimal model selection based on input prompts, it does not explicitly focus on 'hard prefix prompts' or the systematic review of these prompts. Prompt engineering generally refers to the design of input prompts to achieve better performance or more relevant responses from language models. The paper's relevance to prompt engineering is in its ability to select the best-suited model for a given prompt, which could be a component of a larger prompt engineering strategy. However, the absence of specific focus on 'hard prefix prompts' or systematic review thereof limits the relevance score."
vima: robot manipulation with multimodal prompts,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study described in the abstract illustrates a novel application of prompt-based learning in the domain of robotics rather than just natural language processing. The use of 'multimodal prompts' that includes both textual and visual tokens is directly related to the concept of prompt engineering, as it involves crafting prompts that a machine learning model interprets to perform various tasks. Although it does not explicitly address the engineering of 'hard prefix' prompts, the systematic development of multimodal prompts for robot manipulation is a significant contribution to prompt engineering research. The study's relevance is slightly lessened only due to the lack of a specific focus on 'hard prefix' prompts, which the original query stipulates."
prompt-based tuning of transformer models for multi-center medical image segmentation of head and neck cancer,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper describes the use of prompts in the form of 'learnable parameters' for fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformer models in medical image segmentation tasks, which is relevant to the concept of prompt engineering. This kind of study could potentially contribute to the field of prompt engineering as it explores how altering input prompts (in this case, learnable parameters) can adapt a model to new data. However, the focus here is on medical image segmentation and not on textual data or NLP models which are more common areas for prompt engineering. Thus, the relevance is significant but not entirely direct to studies narrowly focused on hard prefix prompts for NLP applications."
tempo: prompt-based generative pre-trained transformer for time series forecasting,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The relevance to prompt engineering study is moderate. The described TEMPO framework does incorporate 'selection-based prompts' which indicates some element of prompt engineering. However, the core focus is on time series forecasting using generative transformers rather than the systematic review or study of hard prefix prompts in general. Therefore, the relevance is partial as it pertains to adapting prompts for time series tasks specifically rather than prompt engineering as a broader field."
prompt-engineering and transformer-based question generation and evaluation,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study presented involves the application of prompt engineering to improve the performance of a transformer-based question generation model. Since prompt engineering is integral to this research, with the effectiveness of various prompts being directly assessed and compared, it shows high relevance to the field of prompt engineering. However, it does not focus solely on 'hard prefix prompts' specifically, which may be a more nuanced subtopic within prompt engineering. Therefore, the relevance rating is not a full 10."
prompt guided transformer for multi-task dense prediction,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The presented abstract describes a research paper regarding a model called Prompt Guided Transformer (PGT), which explicitly utilizes task-specific prompts within its architecture. The use of prompts is integral to the model's operation, making it highly relevant to studies on prompt engineering. However, it seems to focus more on parameter efficiency and architecture design for multi-task learning rather than the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' or broad prompt engineering strategies, hence the rating does not reach the maximum."
efficient model personalization in federated learning via client-specific prompt generation,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract describes a methodology for personalizing machine learning models in a federated learning context using client-specific prompt generation. Although it does not explicitly mention 'hard prefix prompts', it is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it discusses the generation and adaptation of prompts to improve model performance on distributed client-specific data. This is a crucial aspect of prompt engineering, which typically involves optimizing inputs to pre-trained models to achieve better customization and efficiency. Therefore, the relevance of the paper to prompt engineering is high, although it may not directly focus on the specific subset of 'hard prefix prompts'."
kosmos-2.5: a multimodal literate model,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract describes a model that uses task-specific prompts to achieve its multimodal literate capabilities, which is highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering. The ability to adapt the model for various text-intensive image understanding tasks with different prompts through supervised fine-tuning underscores the relevance of prompt engineering to the model's functionality. Although the main focus of Kosmos-2.5 is on machine reading of text-intensive images, the mention of flexible text representations and task-specific prompts indicates that prompt engineering is a significant component of the research. The rating is not a full 10 because the primary focus seems to be on the model's multimodal capabilities rather than exclusively on prompt engineering."
automated reading passage generation with openai's large language model,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study is relevant to prompt engineering as it involves using 'carefully engineered prompts' to guide GPT-3 in generating reading passages that are appropriate for a specific educational level and style. The engineering aspect of the prompts plays a crucial role in the automated item generation process mentioned in the abstract, ensuring that the AI-generated text conforms to certain standards and matches original content in terms of structure and difficulty. While the focus is on AIG and not specifically on the study of 'hard prefix prompts,' the research contributes valuable insights into how tailored prompts can be used to guide the output of a language model to meet predefined criteria. Therefore, it has a significant relevance to the field of prompt engineering, even though it might not directly address the concept of hard prefix prompts in systematic review terms."
prompt tuning gpt-2 language model for parameter-efficient domain adaptation of asr systems,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract discusses the use of 'domain-prompts,' which seems to be a technique closely related to prompt engineering, as it involves training domain-specific embeddings to adapt a language model to new domains. This method resembles hard prompt tuning where prompts are fixed and designed to prime the model for a specific task or domain. The study's relevance is high for prompt engineering research, particularly within the context of ASR systems and parameter-efficient adaptations. However, it doesn't discuss 'hard prefix prompts' specifically; it mentions 'domain-prompts' which may or may not be exactly the same concept. Hence, the rating is not a full 10, reflecting this small uncertainty."
phenaki: variable length video generation from open domain textual description,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract describes a model, Phenaki, which deals with generating videos from textual descriptions using a novel representation and learning approach. This is relevant to prompt engineering to the extent that it involves creating prompts (textual descriptions) that are used to generate content (videos). However, the focus of the study appears to be more on video synthesis and representation learning rather than on the design or optimization of the textual prompts themselves ('hard prefix prompts'). Therefore, the relevance is moderate, indicating a tangential connection to prompt engineering, particularly in how text prompts are used to generate complex media like videos, rather than a direct study on the engineering of prompts."
llama-adapter: efficient fine-tuning of language models with zero-init attention,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract describes the development of a method for fine-tuning language models using a set of learnable adaption prompts, which is relevant to prompt engineering, particularly in the context of instruction-following models. The integration of these prompts into the higher transformer layers is a technique related to prompt engineering as it involves modifying the input sequence to achieve a desired behavior from the model. However, the study seems to be more focused on an efficient fine-tuning mechanism rather than on the specifics of designing prompts (hard prefixes), so it is not a perfect match to prompt engineering studies that focus exclusively on hard prefix prompts. Therefore, the rating acknowledges the relevance of the learnable adaption prompts but is not a full 10 due to the broader scope of the study."
in-context learning of large language models explained as kernel regression,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study presents an analysis of in-context learning in large language models (LLMs), a concept closely related to prompt engineering since in-context learning involves providing LLMs with carefully crafted prompts (examples) to shape their output without updating the models' parameters. Understanding the mechanism behind LLMs' in-context learning capabilities could contribute valuable insights into the design of effective prompts, potentially improving prompt engineering strategies. However, the study does not directly focus on 'hard prefix prompts,' which are specific types of prompts, or on a systematic review of prompt engineering studies, so the relevance is substantial but not complete."
prompt tuning of deep neural networks for speaker-adaptive visual speech recognition,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study presents prompt tuning methods for speaker-adaptive Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), which parallels prompt tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Though the context is VSR rather than text-based models, the principles of prompt engineering (e.g., fine-tuning prompts for adaptation without changing the entire pre-trained model) are highly relevant to the prompt engineering study. As such, the techniques and results from this study could inform prompt engineering practices, especially those that deal with adaptation to new data or domains using small amounts of adaptation data. This makes it significantly relevant, though slightly less if the focus of the prompt engineering study is strictly on text-based NLP models."
à-la-carte prompt tuning (apt): combining distinct data via composable prompting,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract discusses 'À-la-carte Prompt Tuning (APT)' which is directly related to prompt engineering as it deals with the methodology of tuning and composing prompts for transformer-based models. The approach to train individual prompts and compose them based on user-defined criteria is highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering. This could offer insights into the mechanics of prompt tuning and its practical applications in customizing machine learning models to specific data sets or user preferences. The only reason it doesn't score a perfect 10 is that the description does not explicitly mention 'hard prefix prompts', thus it may not cover the entire scope of the prompt engineering study mentioned in the prompt."
proof of concept: using chatgpt to teach emergency physicians how to break bad news,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract highlights the use of detailed prompts to create realistic clinical scenarios and provide feedback, which directly relates to the concept of prompt engineering. The study illustrates the impact of carefully designed prompts on the AI's performance in a specific application (medical training), which is relevant to the field of prompt engineering. However, the focus is not solely on the theoretical or systematic aspects of prompt engineering but rather its practical implementation in a medical training context, which may not cover the depth or breadth of a 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts' as the original query suggests."
promptonomyvit: multi-task prompt learning improves video transformers using synthetic scene data,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The relevance of this study to prompt engineering is moderate to high because it introduces the concept of 'task prompts' within video transformers, which are specialized parameters used for enhancing performance on different video understanding tasks. 'Promptonomy' is essentially an application of prompt engineering in the context of video transformers, where prompts are designed to model task-specific structure and improve machine learning model aptitude. While the study does not explicitly cover 'hard prefix prompts' or their systematic review, it does involve the creation and utilization of prompts in a learning context, thus contributing to the broader field of prompt engineering. However, the main focus is on the usage of synthetic scene data and improving video transformers, so it is not entirely centered on the theory or methodology of prompt engineering itself."
can language models automate data wrangling?,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The content seems to address the utilization of language models for data wrangling tasks, and while it does imply a certain level of task design and user interaction with language models (which could be related to prompt engineering), the focus on data wrangling rather than prompt design specifically for eliciting desired outputs from a language model suggests that this isn't a comprehensive study on hard prefix prompts. There is potential crossover in terms of understanding how prompts work in the context of data wrangling, but it is not directly about prompt engineering."
textdiffuser: diffusion models as text painters,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the study introduces TextDiffuser, which involves generating images from text prompts and might have indirect applications in understanding and improving how models handle text prompts, the main focus is on image generation and enhancing text coherence within visual content. The mention of prompts relates more to the input for image generation rather than the study of prompt engineering itself. Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering study is moderate as the techniques developed could be tangentially useful, but it is not the central theme of the research."
language prompt for autonomous driving,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract describes a study focused on the intersection of natural language prompts and autonomous driving technology, which involves prompt engineering to some extent. Although the primary application is within the domain of computer vision and autonomous driving, the creation of the object-centric language prompt set and the formulation of a new prompt-based driving task indicates a substantial involvement of prompt engineering. The study's goal to predict object trajectories based on language descriptions necessitates understanding and engineering of prompts to be suitable for machine comprehension within a driving context. This is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it deals with generating and utilizing prompts to guide AI models. However, the rating is not a perfect 10 as the core application differs from general prompt engineering studies and focuses specifically on driving scenarios."
vector representations of idioms in conversational systems,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The study is partially relevant to prompt engineering as it touches on how training on specific language constructs (in this case, idioms) improves the performance of conversational systems. While it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' or the systematic review of such prompts, understanding how idiomatic expressions are handled by NLP systems can inform prompt design strategies and might be leveraged in the creation of more sophisticated prompts. This relevance is more tangential than direct to the focus of prompt engineering, thus warranting a mid-range rating."
generalization properties of retrieval-based models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the abstract discusses retrieval-based models and their generalization properties, which are relevant to the broader field of machine learning and could potentially be applied to prompt engineering with respect to selecting the best prompts in a retrieval-based manner, it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' or prompt engineering specifically. Therefore, its relevance to a systematic review on hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering studies is tangential rather than central."
clinical prompt learning with frozen language models.,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract discusses the application of prompt learning in a clinical context, which is a subset of prompt engineering. It highlights the advantages of prompt learning over traditional fine-tuning, such as fewer trainable parameters, less training time, and lower computational resources, all of which are key considerations in prompt engineering. Although it does not explicitly mention 'hard prefix prompts,' the focus on prompt learning's efficiency and effectiveness is highly relevant to the overarching field of prompt engineering. The reason for not giving a full score of 10 is because the study is specific to clinical applications rather than a broad systematic review of hard prefix prompts in general."
fedyolo: augmenting federated learning with pretrained transformers,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract discusses modularity in the context of using modules such as prompts for adapting large pretrained transformer models in federated learning setups. While it does not specifically focus on 'hard prefix prompts,' it does touch on the general relevance of prompts (or similar kinds of modules) for model adaptation. This relevance is given a rating of 7 because the study could provide useful insights into the applications of prompt engineering within federated learning, even though it does not directly focus on a comprehensive systematic review of hard prefix prompts."

While the main focus seems to be on improving ASR and NER performance, the inclusion of prompt design as a part of the fine-tuning process makes it relevant to the study of prompt engineering. However, the mention of prompts is not the central focus of the paper, which suggests that although prompt engineering is covered, it is not the primary subject matter, hence the rating of 7."
prores: exploring degradation-aware visual prompt for universal image restoration,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract discusses the use of degradation-aware visual prompts within a universal image restoration model, which is a form of prompt engineering applied to visual tasks rather than language tasks. It touches on the principle of encoding information (degradation types) into prompts to guide the behavior of a model (Vision Transformer), a concept parallel to hard prefix prompts in NLP. While the paper does not deal directly with linguistic prompt engineering, the underlying ideas of customizing prompts to steer model behavior are highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering as a broader concept. Hence, a lower rating would be given if the question strictly asked for relevance to text-based prompts, but since it outlines the foundation of 'prompt engineering' which can extend beyond just language models, a higher rating is appropriate."
attention satisfies: a constraint-satisfaction lens on factual errors of language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract provides insights into the internal mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs) related to factual accuracy, which is peripherally relevant to prompt engineering. Prompt engineering often involves crafting prompts to elicit accurate and reliable responses from a model. The study's focus on the attention mechanism and factual accuracy can be indirectly useful in understanding how prompts might be structured to improve the likelihood of factually correct outputs. However, the study does not directly investigate hard prefix prompts or prompt engineering techniques, therefore the rating isn't higher."
making humanoid robots teaching assistants by using natural language processing (nlp) cloud-based services,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study involves using NLP and GPT language models, which are relevant to prompt engineering. The research is focused on fine-tuning GPT models with prompts derived from environmental context and robot actions, directly linking to the construction of prompts for language models. The rating is not a full 10 because the main application is on human-robot interaction and the deployment of these models, rather than on the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' or the discipline of prompt engineering itself."
prompt generation networks for input-based adaptation of frozen vision transformers,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract describes a novel approach to adapt frozen vision transformers via visual prompt learning, which is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it deals with generating and optimizing prompts that can be input-dependent. Although the study focuses on the visual domain, the techniques and concepts of prompt generation, learning, and the mentioned 'prompt inversion' trick are applicable and insightful for prompt engineering for different modalities. It achieves adaptation without modifying the model and is part of the broader discussion on how to efficiently use large-scale models, a significant aspect of prompt engineering. The relevance is slightly less than perfect because the specific focus on vision transformers and input-dependent prompts may not cover the entire scope of hard prefix prompts directly, but the principles are closely related."
optimizing language models for argumentative reasoning,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The provided abstract details an investigation into optimizing a language model for argumentative reasoning tasks, which includes an evaluation of different optimization strategies such as prompt programming. Prompt engineering, which refers to the design and usage of prompts to guide language models, is closely related to the study's focus on prompt programming as one of the optimization strategies. Although the term 'hard prefix prompts' is not explicitly mentioned, prompt programming is a technique that often involves the use of hardcoded prompts (which could be considered 'hard prefix prompts') to direct a model's output. Therefore, this study is highly relevant to the broader field of prompt engineering; however, the relevance is slightly lower as the study does not solely concentrate on hard prefix prompts but also considers other optimization strategies."
prompt enhanced generative mrc framework for pancreatic cancer ner,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper directly engages with prompt engineering through its introduction of continuous prompts to improve the performance of a generative NER task within the context of medical document analysis. The use of prompts in the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer model is relevant to the study of how prompts can be optimized to facilitate better understanding and generation of responses by the model. While the focus is not exclusively on 'hard prefix prompts' and it is more application specific (medical NER), it does contribute to the broader understanding of prompt engineering in NER tasks."

This relates closely to prompt engineering, as the research aims to determine how best to elicit desired responses from language models, which is a fundamental aspect of prompt engineering. The methodology of prompt prediction is directly relevant to the art of crafting effective prompts. However, the specific application to vision-language learning might be slightly tangential to more general prompt engineering studies that might not focus on multimodal contexts. Despite that, the principles discussed could nonetheless provide valuable insights into prompt engineering for LLMs in general."
prompt-based ingredient-oriented all-in-one image restoration,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract describes a novel technique for image restoration that uses 'prompt-based learning' as part of its methodology. This indicates some relevance to prompt engineering as it pertains to the use of prompts to guide the decoder in image processing tasks. However, the term 'prompt-based learning' in this context is more related to the domain of image restoration rather than to the development and study of textual or linguistic prompts in AI and machine learning. Even though the technique involves 'prompts' in some form, it may not specifically address the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' as one might expect in the study of AI or natural language processing. Therefore, the relevance is moderate since it's within the area of prompts as a concept but not directly focused on the linguistic aspect of prompt engineering."

The hierarchical prompt tuning model addresses the need for effective prompts in multi-task learning, especially in few-shot scenarios. The introduction of shared prompts, auto-adaptive prompts, and task-specific prompts directly pertains to the methodology of engineering prompts to enhance performance. Although the study is not specifically about 'hard prefix prompts', the relevance to prompt engineering is strong because the paper contributes to the broader understanding of how to construct and implement prompts in complex, multi-layer neural networks such as Transformers."

It focuses on prompt-based strategies to bridge the gap between different data distributions. The concept of 'prompt memory' is relevant to prompt engineering, as it involves using prompts to encode domain-specific knowledge which can then influence the behavior of a model. However, the application of prompts here differs from their use in language models, where the term 'prompt engineering' is often used to describe the process of crafting inputs that elicit desired outputs. In this context, prompts are aiding domain adaptation of object detection systems rather than natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, the use of prompts as a technique to improve machine learning models is relevant to the broader field of prompt engineering study."
visual prompt flexible-modal face anti-spoofing,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract discusses the development of a visual prompt-based approach for improving the robustness of face anti-spoofing systems, which is indirectly related to prompt engineering. Although prompt engineering is primarily associated with natural language processing and the use of textual prompts in language models, the abstract suggests an adaptation of prompt learning principles to the domain of computer vision and multimodal learning. The concept of 'visual prompts' and their application in a flexible-modal face anti-spoofing task is relevant to the study of how prompts can be engineered and utilized in AI models, extending beyond textual inputs to visual and multimodal contexts. The relevance is not a direct match to 'hard prefix prompts,' indicating that the context of prompts is being extended to a different domain, thus the rating does not reach the maximum."

The focus on one-stage elicitation techniques, the influence of different prompting strategies such as zero-shot learning, task specification, and the exploration of hard prefix prompts (detailed in the mention of the textual context, number of examples, and label definitions) are highly relevant to prompt engineering. Although it doesn't exclusively concentrate on 'hard prefix prompts,' the exploration and systematic review of prompting strategies contributing to performance improvement are central to prompt engineering. The slight deduction in the rating acknowledges that the study is about prompt engineering as a whole rather than solely on 'hard prefix prompts.'"
on the relationship between skill neurons and robustness in prompt tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The paper discusses Prompt Tuning, which is highly relevant for prompt engineering as it studies how prompt tuning affects the robustness and transferability of pre-trained language models for specific tasks. Although it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts', the concept of 'skill neurons' and their role in prompt tuning is crucial for understanding and engineering effective prompts. It hints at an underlying mechanism that could influence the construction and refinement of prompts, potentially making this area of study valuable for those engaged in prompt engineering."
efficient domain adaptation of language models in asr systems using prompt-tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract presents research on using prompt-tuning, a form of prompt engineering, for domain adaptation in ASR systems. Although the focus is on ASR systems and not specifically on 'hard prefix prompts', prompt-tuning is related to prompt engineering studies. The research seems to involve adapting language models to specific domains using prompts, which is a core aspect of prompt engineering. The methodology could be highly relevant to those interested in tailoring LMs for specific applications without the costs associated with maintaining multiple domain-specific models.

Although the abstract does not specifically mention 'hard prefix prompts,' the concept of prompt design for task efficiency and model performance improvement is central to the topic of prompt engineering. Therefore, the relevance rating is relatively high, with a couple points deducted for not mentioning the specific aspect of 'hard prefix prompts.'"
medical intervention duration estimation using language-enhanced transformer encoder with medical prompts,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study describes a framework that integrates medical prompts within a transformer encoder to improve the estimation of medical intervention durations. While this approach does utilize 'prompts' in the form of medical queries to improve the model's understanding of free-text EHR data, these prompts do not appear to be 'hard prefix prompts' in the context of prompting techniques typically discussed in natural language processing (NLP). The focus of the study is not on exploring the design or effectiveness of various prompts but rather on the application of medical prompts to harmonize different data modalities for medical predictions. Therefore, while prompts are relevant to the system being developed, the study does not seem to primarily address 'prompt engineering' as it would pertain to the generation or optimization of prompts themselves. This results in a moderate rating of relevance."
ctrl: a conditional transformer language model for controllable generation,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The referenced paper describes a language model (CTRL) designed to incorporate control codes that can direct the generation of text according to specified attributes, which is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering. Although the paper does not directly discuss 'hard prefix prompts,' it is nonetheless pertinent because control codes essentially function as a form of prompts to guide the model output. The ability to use these codes aligns with the broader goal of prompt engineering, which is to control and guide the behavior of language models. Therefore, the paper is quite relevant to the study of prompting methods in AI, even if it doesn't address 'hard prefix prompts' specifically."
exploring visual prompts for adapting large-scale models,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract indicates the study focuses on 'visual prompting' to adapt large-scale models in vision, which is a form of prompt engineering. While 'hard prefix prompts' are not directly mentioned, the concept of adapting models by using prompts (here, visual) is central to the discussed approach, thus making it relevant to the field of prompt engineering. The study’s relevance could be even higher if it specifically related to textual prompts and hard prefixes, but its focus on a related concept in the visual domain still provides valuable insights that could be transferable to other forms of prompt engineering."
gpt4mia: utilizing geneative pre-trained transformer (gpt-3) as a plug-and-play transductive model for medical image analysis,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The relevance of the paper to prompt engineering is tangential rather than direct. It discusses using GPT-3 as a tool for medical image analysis, which implies a level of prompt engineering in structuring the interaction between the language model and the image analysis tasks. The paper's focus on technical treatments for efficiency and effectiveness might involve innovative prompt design strategies, which is pertinent to prompt engineering. However, because the central theme is the application of GPT-3 to medical image analysis rather than prompt engineering itself, the relevance is moderate."

Though the concept of 'hard prefix prompts' as specified in the initial request is not addressed directly, the nature of modifying LLM behavior through specific prompting techniques (metacognitive prompting) is highly relevant to enhancing the understanding of how prompts affect model performance and behavior. Therefore, the study is considerably relevant as it focuses on systematic approaches to improve interaction quality between humans and AI via prompts, which could indirectly contribute to the understanding and development of hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering."
automatic hallucination assessment for aligned large language models via transferable adversarial attacks,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it explores the creation of prompts (in this case, adversarial attacks) that influence language model performance. This involves understanding how prompting affects LLM behavior and assessing the models' reliability, which is a core aspect of prompt engineering. The use of prompting chaining is directly related to the design and engineering of prompts that can manipulate or test the behavior of LLMs. Although the study's focus is on hallucination and the generation of evaluation data, the methods used are a part of prompt engineering practices."
improving few-shot generalization of safety classifiers via data augmented parameter-efficient fine-tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it explores the use of prompt-tuning (a form of prompt engineering) combined with data augmentation to improve the performance of language models on safety classification tasks. This work directly pertains to the field of prompt engineering, as it aims to enhance model generalization using techniques that modify the input prompt structure to better guide the model in few-shot learning scenarios. The approach mentioned, similarity-based data-augmentation + prompt-tuning (DAPT), is a specific instance of prompt engineering, thus making the study quite relevant. Despite the focus on domain-generalized few-shot learning for safety applications and not solely on 'hard prefix prompts', the paper’s exploration of prompt-tuning in practice warrants a high relevance score."
evaluation of gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 for supporting real-world information needs in healthcare delivery,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract highlights the need for further research in prompt engineering to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare settings. It mentions the variability in the quality of responses by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to specific information needs, which implies that there is room for improvement in how prompts are designed to achieve better results. This is relevant to the study of prompt engineering since it suggests that better-designed prompts could potentially lead to more accurate and useful responses from LLMs. However, the abstract does not directly focus on 'hard prefix prompts' but rather on the broader application of LLMs in healthcare. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant but not fully focused on prompt engineering, hence the rating of 6."
tempera: test-time prompt editing via reinforcement learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The paper's abstract indicates that the work is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it presents a novel method (TEMPERA) which focuses on editing prompts using reinforcement learning. This directly aligns with innovations and advancements in prompt design strategies for large language models, which is at the heart of prompt engineering studies. The only reason the rating is not a full 10 is that the relevance might be slightly more specific to reinforcement learning techniques in prompt engineering rather than a broad systematic review on 'hard prefix prompts'. However, the contributions to optimizing prompts and improving sample efficiency are very pertinent to the field."
gpt-4 is too smart to be safe: stealthy chat with llms via cipher,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The relevance of this study to prompt engineering is high because it directly investigates the interaction dynamics between humans and LLMs (Large Language Models) by introducing a novel method of communication—CipherChat. This approach challenges existing safety alignment techniques, which are crucial for prompt engineering as they ensure that model responses align with intended outcomes and ethical guidelines. The use of ciphers as a tool to test and potentially enhance LLMs' interpretative faculties aligns with prompt engineering strategies that seek to refine how models understand and generate language-based responses. Furthermore, the discovery of a 'secret cipher' within LLMs and the development of a SelfCipher method pertains to advanced prompt engineering, where understanding model behavior in non-natural languages can lead to more sophisticated and safer human-AI interactions. However, because the study primarily focuses on safety alignment and communication in ciphers, which are a subset of prompt engineering tasks, it does not fully encompass the breadth of prompt engineering studies. Hence, the rating falls short of a perfect score."
chatspot: bootstrapping multimodal llms via precise referring instruction tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study primarily focuses on improving human-AI interactivity within multimodal large language models by introducing a more sophisticated method of instruction via referring prompts. While this does involve some form of prompt engineering, specifically in relation to how the model receives and understands instructions, it is not strictly concerned with 'hard prefix prompts' as it seems to combine multiple input modalities (language, clicks, drag-and-drop, drawings). The relevance is thus moderate because it does intersect with the concept of prompt design and efficacy but does not explicitly address the engineering of hard-coded text prompts within a linguistic context."
ask an expert: leveraging language models to improve strategic reasoning in goal-oriented dialogue models,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study focuses on incorporating strategic reasoning into dialogue models through the use of specialized prompts, which is related to prompt engineering.

This framework relies on pre-specified prompts to direct the conversation, which is a core aspect of prompt engineering. The relevance to prompt engineering is high, but the rating is not a full 10 due to the absence of a direct focus on 'hard prefix prompts' specifically."
zero-shot visual relation detection via composite visual cues from large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The described study's focus on using language model-generated description-based prompts, referred to as 'Composite Description prompts', to improve zero-shot visual relation detection directly relates to the field of prompt engineering. The systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' could encompass studies that explore innovative ways of combining language models with vision tasks, including the generation of prompts to guide visual recognition. Furthermore, the introduction of a chain-of-thought method to prompt language models for weight generation aligns with strategic prompt design to elicit specific model behaviors. Thus, the relevance is high, though not a perfect 10 as the primary focus is on visual relation detection rather than prompt engineering exclusively."
chill: zero-shot custom interpretable feature extraction from clinical notes with large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The described study focuses on using expert-crafted queries to generate interpretable features from health records, which indirectly relates to prompt engineering since it involves crafting queries (prompts) for a model to generate useful outputs. However, the study applies the technique for feature extraction from clinical notes rather than the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts,' which is more specific to improving prompt engineering methods or understanding their efficacy. Therefore, the relevance is moderate but not directly focused on the prompt engineering field as defined by the initial prompt."
can llms keep a secret? testing privacy implications of language models via contextual integrity theory,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study discusses the implications of information handling by large language models (LLMs), which relates to how these models process and output information based on the instructions (prompts) they receive. While it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' it touches on the broader topic of prompt design and its influence on model behavior, particularly regarding privacy. It is relevant to prompt engineering since understanding and improving the privacy reasoning capabilities of LLMs can lead to the development of better prompts that protect user privacy. The rating is not a perfect 10 because the study's focus is on privacy and not explicitly on the structure or format of the prompts themselves, which would be a central aspect of a study dedicated entirely to prompt engineering."
interleaving pre-trained language models and large language models for zero-shot nl2sql generation,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract discusses the development of a framework (ZeroNL2SQL) that involves using prompts to guide language models for a specialized task (NL2SQL generation). Although the specific term 'hard prefix prompts' is not used, the concept of using prompts to direct language model behavior is central to the study. This indicates some relevance to the study of prompt engineering but not directly focused on hard prefix prompts or a systematic review of them. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to prompt engineering but not fully aligned with a comprehensive systematic review on that specific topic."
distinguish before answer: generating contrastive explanation as knowledge for commonsense question answering,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract describes CPACE, a model that uses explanation prompts to generate contrastive explanations from symbolic knowledge, which is particularly relevant to the field of prompt engineering. The use of prompts to guide the generation of explanations indicates that this research is focused on enhancing the interpretability and effectiveness of a question answering system through careful design of prompts. While not exclusively focused on 'hard prefix prompts', the study emphasizes the use of prompts in an AI model, which aligns with studies in prompt engineering. The relevance rating is not the maximum because the connection to 'hard prefix prompts' is not direct, yet the concept of using prompts to drive AI behavior is central to the research presented."
using global land cover product as prompt for cropland mapping via visual foundation model,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract discusses leveraging the 'Pretrain+Prompting' paradigm, which is relevant to prompt engineering as it involves designing prompts to aid in domain adaptation for cropland mapping. The introduction of the auto-prompting (APT) method aligns with prompt engineering by using prompts to modify the behavior of pre-trained models on specific tasks. However, the direct focus on cropland mapping and the use of visual foundation models means it is not exclusively centered on prompt engineering but rather its application in a specific domain. Thus, it is moderately relevant but not a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts."
epa: easy prompt augmentation on large language models via multiple sources and multiple targets,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper describes a method called EPA (Easy Prompt Augmentation) which is directly related to prompt engineering. It improves the performance of large language models by augmenting task prompts with paraphrased demonstrations, reducing the user's effort in creating effective prompts. Since the study is about a technique to enhance prompt efficacy for NLP tasks, it has high relevance to the field of prompt engineering. However, the information provided does not explicitly mention 'hard prefix prompts', which was the specific topic of interest mentioned in the original inquiry, thus the rating is not a full 10."
expclip: bridging text and facial expressions via semantic alignment,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract describes a research study that focuses on using natural language prompts to control the style of facial expressions in speech-driven animation, which is relevant to prompt engineering in the context of using language prompts for specific tasks. However, the primary application is in the domain of facial animation rather than prompt engineering for text generation or data processing tasks. Nevertheless, the study's use of a CLIP-based model and the development of a Text-Expression Alignment Dataset (TEAD) suggests significant overlap with prompt engineering methodologies, as it involves the alignment of text prompts with emotional expressions. The relevance is not complete as the scope of prompt engineering can be more extensive, but the techniques and mechanisms such as automatic annotation with LLMs and Expression Prompt Augmentation (EPA) are of interest to the field of prompt engineering."
divknowqa: assessing the reasoning ability of llms via open-domain question answering over knowledge base and text,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study focuses on the retrieval capabilities of Large Language Models and how they can be grounded on heterogeneous knowledge sources for better question-answering performances. While it relates to prompt engineering in the broader context of machine learning and enhancing LLMs' interactions with external data, the study's primary concern is not with hard prefix prompts directly but rather with improving the information retrieval process, which is a component of the system that supports effective prompting. Therefore, its relevance to prompt engineering, specifically to a systematic review of hard prefix prompts, is tangential rather than central."
tailoring personality traits in large language models via unsupervisedly-built personalized lexicons,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study described in the abstract addresses the manipulation of language models' outputs by tailoring personality traits, which is related to prompt engineering in the sense that it involves guiding the language model to generate text with certain characteristics. Although the main focus is on personality traits via lexical choices rather than 'hard prefix prompts,' it still falls within the broader scope of controlling language model behavior, which is a key aspect of prompt engineering. Thus, the relevance is significant but not directly aligned with hard prefix prompts, hence the rating is not a full 10."
denevil: towards deciphering and navigating the ethical values of large language models via instruction learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The described paper is highly relevant to prompt engineering, as it develops a novel prompt generation algorithm (DeNEVIL) that interacts with large language models to explore and expose their ethical value alignment through instructions. Although not directly labeled as 'hard prefix prompts,' the concept of generating prompts to induce model behavior aligns with studies concerning prompt design and efficacy. The focus on ethical considerations adds a dimension of value-based prompt engineering, which is a specialized and relevant aspect of the broader field of prompt engineering studies."
pitl: cross-modal retrieval with weakly-supervised vision-language pre-training via prompting,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering as it describes a method to improve the performance of vision-language pre-training models by using prompts to elicit knowledge from large language models. The method, called Prompts-in-The-Loop (PiTL), uses prompts to generate language counterparts for images, which reduces the need for paired image-text data and is a direct application of prompt engineering techniques. Although the study does not specifically focus on 'hard prefix prompts', it is still related to the broader area of prompt engineering, hence the rating of 8."
vision-language interpreter for robot task planning,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study discussed in the abstract is moderately relevant to prompt engineering, as it deals with the generation of problem descriptions (PDs) from language instructions, which is a component of prompt engineering. In prompt engineering, one must design prompts that effectively communicate tasks to language models, and here, the model is interpreting language to create PDs for robot task planning. Although the study focuses on robot planning and multimodal inputs, the underlying principle of translating natural language into machine-readable formats aligns with the techniques and goals of prompt engineering. The interdisciplinary nature of this research, combining language models with symbolic planners, reflects the complexity encountered in prompt engineering scenarios. However, it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' which suggests it is not fully specialized in the field of prompt engineering but is nonetheless relevant."
prompting with pseudo-code instructions,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper directly addresses the concept of 'prompt engineering' by exploring the use of pseudo-code as a form of prompt style for improving the performance of pre-trained language models. It compares pseudo-code prompts with natural language prompts and presents empirical results showing the effectiveness of pseudo-code, which includes structural elements pertinent to the field of prompt engineering. The improvement in performance metrics like F1 scores for classification and ROUGE-L scores for generative tasks indicates a significant relevance to the area of study. However, it focuses specifically on pseudo-code prompting rather than a broader range of hard prefix prompts, which is why the rating is not a full 10."

Prompt engineering is directly related to the design of these fine-grained prompts, making it highly relevant to the stated topic. The use of prompts within a Visual-Linguistic Face Forgery Detection system to improve semantic information and interpretability aligns with the study of hard prefix prompts which are designed for better interaction between language and models. The rating isn't a full 10 because the study focuses on a specific application of prompts in face forgery detection rather than a broad systematic review of hard prefix prompts across various domains."
forgetful large language models: lessons learned from using llms in robot programming,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract indicates a study focused on reducing errors in execution of robotic programming tasks by employing language models with prompts. Although it concentrates on the 'forgetfulness' of LLMs and proposes solutions through prompt engineering tactics, it doesn't strictly cover 'hard prefix prompts' as the original study question suggests. However, the relevance is quite high as the paper seems to be a direct application of prompt engineering to improve task performance. Just the focus on prefix prompts specifically is not stated, which slightly reduces the rating."
interpretable unified language checking,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract mentions the use of a 'simple, few-shot, unified set of prompts' for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on a variety of language checking tasks. This indicates that the research involved studies on how prompt engineering can enhance the capabilities of LLMs in detecting misinformation, stereotypes, and hate speech. Although the focus is not solely on 'hard prefix prompts,' the relevance to prompt engineering is clear because the study explores how different kinds of prompts can affect the performance of LLMs on specific language tasks. The rating is not a full 10 because the abstract does not focus exclusively on systematic review of prompt engineering or on 'hard prefix prompts', which are specific types of prompts used to control the behavior of language models."
genrec: large language model for generative recommendation,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract indicates the use of 'specialized prompts' to improve the ability of a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand recommendation tasks, which implies a form of prompt engineering. Since prompt engineering is essential for fine-tuning LLMs to perform specific tasks such as generative recommendation, and this paper discusses formulating these prompts, it has a substantial relevance to prompt engineering study. However, the focus of the abstract seems more on the application of large language models for recommendation systems rather than the detailed study of hard prefix prompts, which prevents a perfect score."

It directly addresses the challenge of prompt selection in LLMs, aiming to improve both the precision of responses and the interpretability of the prompting process. The focus on Chain-of-Thought reasoning, a method that has shown promise for enhancing the quality of LLM outputs, further emphasizes its relevance to the current landscape of prompt engineering. The introduction of FedLogic to navigate the complexities of multi-domain prompt selection and its emphasis on a theoretical framework and constraint incorporation suggests significant contributions to the field of prompt engineering. The only reason it doesn't score a full 10 is that the abstract does not mention 'hard prefix prompts,' which might be understood as a subset or a particular method within prompt engineering; the paper seems to focus more broadly on CoT prompts."
robust preference learning for storytelling via contrastive reinforcement learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract describes an approach to controlled automated story generation that involves a level of prompt engineering, particularly in the fine-tuning phase using prompt-learning techniques. This suggests relevance to the study of prompt engineering, especially in the context of enhancing the robustness of a generative model's outputs with respect to user preferences. However, the focus of the study is on contrastive reinforcement learning rather than exclusively on hard prefix prompts or a detailed dissection of prompt engineering approaches. The relevance is therefore notable but not comprehensive concerning prompt engineering as a broad field."
using natural language explanations to rescale human judgments,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract describes a study involving the use of large language models (LLMs) to rescale human judgment annotations based on natural language explanations. This is relevant to prompt engineering as it directly pertains to the optimization of LLM outputs through the integration of human feedback. Specifically, feeding Likert ratings and explanations into an LLM to homogenize ratings across annotators is a form of prompt design that guides the model to generate more consistent and possibly more reliable numeric scores. The technique is studied within the context of a specific NLP task (document-grounded question answering), and it addresses challenges inherent in subjective human evaluations which are critical for training and evaluating LLMs. The relevance is not rated higher because the study is more focused on the annotation process and the rescaling of human judgments rather than the construction of hard prefix prompts specifically."
chain-of-thought prompt distillation for multimodal named entity recognition and multimodal relation extraction,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract discusses leveraging the 'chain of thought' (CoT) as an intermediate reasoning process for distilling knowledge from large language models to a student model, which is highly relevant to prompt engineering. This process directly involves designing prompts to elicit reasoning steps, indicating how the model should approach a problem, thus involving prompt engineering. However, the focus is primarily on multimodal named entity recognition and relation extraction, so it is not entirely within the realm of hard prefix prompts in a strict sense, hence the rating is not a full 10."

While the title does not explicitly mention 'hard prefix prompts', the 'LLM Engine' described operates with some form of prompt that guides the generation process. This indicates that the study does indeed involve an aspect of prompt engineering, particularly as it pertains to the synthesis of graphic designs. However, as the prompt in question specifically asks for a 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts,' an approach or a model that is not the primary subject of this paper, the relevance is not maximal. Therefore, the rating reflects high relevance to prompt engineering in general but not a perfect match to the exact subject of 'hard prefix prompts.'"
context-aware prompt tuning for vision-language model with dual-alignment,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract describes the development and application of a method called Dual-Aligned Prompt Tuning (DuAl-PT) in the context of vision-language models, which is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is a critical aspect of adapting large models to specific tasks, and the introduction of a novel method that utilizes both pre-trained language models and alignment techniques directly pertains to advancements in prompt engineering. The high relevance is underscored by the explicit focus on improving the efficiency and context-awareness of prompts, which are key goals in prompt engineering. The reason for not giving a perfect 10 is that the abstract does not focus on 'hard prefix prompts' specifically but rather on prompt learning methods in general, which encompasses a wider field than the specified study area."
de-diffusion makes text a strong cross-modal interface,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The title and abstract suggest that the study focuses on encoding images as text for use in a cross-modal interface, which has relevance to prompt engineering considering that prompts are a form of text input. The approach allows for the use of natural language as an interface to interact with images and demonstrates the potential to prompt large language models for multi-modal tasks. The relevance to prompt engineering is significant due to the generation of text representations that can serve as prompts and the improvement in interfacing with text-to-image tools. However, the paper is more focused on the cross-modal exchange and image representation than on the design or optimization of prompts themselves, which are typically the main focus in prompt engineering studies."

collaborative large language model for recommender systems,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract mentions the development of CLLM4Rec, which incorporates a 'soft+hard prompting strategy' during the pretraining stage for language modeling on recommendation system-specific corpora. The mention of hard prompts directly ties to prompt engineering, particularly within the context of integrating these prompts to improve the performance of a recommender system driven by a large language model. Given that the paper appears to specifically address and include prompt engineering strategies, it is relevant to studies of prompt engineering albeit focused more on the application within recommender systems rather than a general discussion or a review of hard prefix prompts in a wide array of domains. The rating is not a full 10 because the primary focus is on the recommender systems with prompt engineering being an element of the solution rather than the main subject of the paper."
can large language models be good path planners? a benchmark and investigation on spatial-temporal reasoning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The title and abstract indicate research dealing with how large language models can handle tasks requiring spatial-temporal reasoning, which includes the analysis of few-shot prompting methodologies. These methodologies are a subset of prompt engineering, as they explore how to design prompts that enable language models to perform spatial reasoning tasks. While the focus is not explicitly on 'hard prefix prompts' as the prompt engineering study may suggest, few-shot prompting, as part of prompt engineering, is relevant because it discusses the effectiveness of different prompting techniques. Therefore, the study is indirectly related to the broader field of prompt engineering but does not directly address the comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts."
automated assessment of comprehension strategies from self-explanations using llms,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study's focus on leveraging open-source Large Language Models for the assessment of comprehension strategies is highly relevant to prompt engineering given that it employs the technique of fine-tuning LLMs and providing examples via prompts to improve performance. This is particularly pertinent to the field of prompt engineering as it directly involves strategies for optimizing the interaction with LLMs to achieve better outcomes in understanding and generating text.

While the main focus appears to be on the economic efficiency of using distilled language models, prompt engineering is directly mentioned as one of the methods assessed. Therefore, it is relevant from the perspective of comparing the effectiveness and costs of different methods of leveraging LLMs, including prompt engineering. However, the complete focus on prompt engineering is not evident, thus not deserving a full score."
curriculum prompt learning with self-training for abstractive dialogue summarization,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper presents a curriculum-based prompt learning method which is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering. The method's gradual increase in prompt perturbation is particularly pertinent to the study of hard prefix prompts, as it deals with enhancing the model's understanding through strategically structured prompts. However, it doesn't focus exclusively on 'hard prefix prompts' but rather on prompt learning in general within the specific application of dialogue summarization. Thus, while the paper is relevant due to its focus on innovative prompt engineering techniques, the relevance is not perfect as the study does not solely center on hard prefix prompts per se."
the impact of scaffolding prompts on the collaborative problem solving of ill-structured tasks by undergraduate engineering student groups,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The study seems to focus on scaffolding prompts in the context of collaborative problem solving for ill-structured tasks, rather than hard prefix prompts specifically. Nonetheless, the research is relevant to the field of prompt engineering to some extent because it explores how certain types of prompts can affect the problem-solving abilities of engineering students. This could indirectly inform studies or practices within prompt engineering, especially concerning the design of prompts that facilitate learning and problem-solving in educational settings."
meta-augmented prompt tuning for better few-shot learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study mentioned in the abstract addresses issues related to prompt tuning, particularly in the context of few-shot learning. While prompt tuning is directly relevant to prompt engineering, the study focuses on soft prompts rather than hard prefix prompts. The proposed SUMMER framework seeks to improve the initialization and generalizability of soft prompts, which is suggestive of techniques that could potentially be applicable to a broader set of prompt engineering challenges. However, since the study is not specifically about hard prefix prompts, the relevance is significant but not direct, leading to a rating of 7."
exploring the impacts of cognitive and metacognitive prompting on students’ scientific inquiry practices within an e-learning environment,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the study focuses on the use of prompts to enhance scientific inquiry in an educational context, and thus tangentially touches upon the concept of prompting, it does not directly address prompt engineering related to natural language processing or AI prompt design. The relevance lies in the investigation of prompts effectiveness, which could be conceptually extended to prompt engineering for AI systems. However, the study's primary focus on educational cognitive and metacognitive prompts limits its direct applicability to prompt engineering study, specifically regarding hard prefix prompts."
autotutor: a tutor with dialogue in natural language,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the 'autotutor' paper focuses on a system that uses dialogue in natural language, which is tangentially related to prompt engineering in the sense that it deals with natural language processing and potentially the design of prompts for tutorial purposes, it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' or systematic reviews related to prompt engineering studies. The connection to prompt engineering is more incidental as it relates to dialogue patterns and design, which might apply to the field but are not centrally concerned with the systematic approaches to hard prefix prompts specifically. Therefore, the relevance is moderate, as some of the underlying principles may be applicable, but the core subject of the study diverges from the specific focus on prompt engineering."
combating the covid-19 infodemic using prompt-based curriculum learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract suggests that the study involves a prompt-based curriculum learning method, which is connected to the field of prompt engineering, as it implies the use of prompts to extract reliable information from a text. This method seems to be focused on content verification, relevant to the application of prompt engineering in creating models that combat misinformation—a key aspect of information processing and decision-making for AI language models. However, the absence of specific details on 'hard prefix prompts' means the study may not be exclusively focused on the aspect of 'hard prefix prompts' in prompt engineering, thus not warranting a higher relevance score."

This seems relevant for prompt engineering studies since it likely deals with the creation and optimization of prompts for machine learning tasks. However, without an abstract or TLDR, it's difficult to determine the exact focus of the paper and its direct applicability to hard prefix prompts, hence the relevance is not rated higher."
fpc: fine-tuning with prompt curriculum for relation extraction,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,The paper's focus on prompt-based fine-tuning aligns closely with the study of prompt engineering. It explores how prompts can be designed and utilized to improve the performance of relation extraction tasks by capturing the semantics of relation labels. The concept of a 'Prompt Curriculum' contributes to the field by addressing how to incrementally build up a model's capacity through prompts. This is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it deals with strategic prompt design and application in the context of fine-tuning pre-trained language models. The reason it is not a full 10 is because it is specific to relation extraction and may not cover every aspect of prompt engineering in a broader sense.
learning to perform complex tasks through compositional fine-tuning of language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract describes a method related to prompt engineering — compositional fine-tuning (CFT). While it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' it does engage with the broader theme of structuring the interaction with language models to improve task performance. The work on CFT contributes to our understanding of how tasks can be decomposed and taught to language models, which is relevant to the study of how prompts can be designed and optimized. This is tangentially related to hard prefix prompts, as both are concerned with the efficacy of input structures for language models. However, the focus on CFT instead of hard prefix prompts directly means the relevance is significant but not complete."
which prompts make the difference? data prioritization for efficient human llm evaluation,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The provided title and abstract describe a study focused on the optimization of human evaluations of large language models through data prioritization, which is indirectly relevant to prompt engineering. Prompt engineering typically involves constructing prompts to elicit specific outputs from language models but does not directly address the question of human evaluators in the loop. However, the study's implications for improving the efficiency of model-evaluation can influence the prompt engineering process indirectly by refining the human feedback loop connected to prompt tuning performances. This makes it somewhat relevant to prompt engineering, especially in the scope of human-in-the-loop evaluations and performance measurement. Nonetheless, the study does not seem to address 'hard prefix prompts' or any specific prompt engineering methodologies, which limits its direct relevance to the field of prompt engineering."
"conversational challenges in ai-powered data science: obstacles, needs, and design opportunities",gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study addresses some core issues related to prompt engineering, such as formulating prompts for complex tasks and refining prompts iteratively. These topics are highly relevant to the field, as effective communication with LLMs is contingent upon constructing well-defined prompts. However, the study seems to focus more broadly on conversational challenges in AI within data science, rather than exclusively on 'hard prefix prompts' or systematic reviews on prompt engineering. Thus, while the content is relevant, it does not specifically target hard prefix prompts or provide a comprehensive systematic review, which the prompt specifically asks for."
cona: a novel context-aware instruction paradigm for communication using large language model,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract discusses CONA, a context-aware instruction paradigm designed for effective knowledge dissemination with GPT models, which certainly falls under the broader category of prompt engineering, as it explores new methods for communication and interaction with LLMs. Despite not addressing 'hard prefix prompts' specifically, it presents a framework that utilizes the mechanisms of prompt engineering to optimize interactions with LLMs. However, the connection to 'hard prefix prompts' is not explicit, hence the rating is not a full 10."

It explicitly mentions the study of prompt engineering in the context of providing the AI model with the right context and assessing the impact of that context on the quality of the code suggestions. While the study seems more broadly focused on the overall design and factors affecting code completion tools, prompt engineering is indeed a crucial aspect of the thesis as it can greatly influence the AI model's performance. Therefore, it is highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering, though it might not focus solely on 'hard prefix prompts' as specified in the original prompt."
incremental learning of humanoid robot behavior from natural interaction and large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study discusses the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the behavior orchestration of a humanoid robot, focusing on natural-language interaction and incremental learning through feedback loops. While not directly focusing on hard prefix prompts, the concept of 'incremental prompt learning' is introduced, where the system learns and modifies its interactions based on human feedback. This relates to prompt engineering in the broader sense because it involves designing and refining prompts that the LLM uses to generate proper Python statements, which directly affect the robot's actions. However, the study does not appear to specifically address hard prefix prompts or a systematic review thereof, hence the score is not a full 10, reflecting its partial relevance to the specific area of prompt engineering mentioned in the initial query."
tree-planner: efficient close-loop task planning with large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper discusses an approach to task planning with Large Language Models that includes the use of prompts to generate plans, which is closely linked to the concept of prompt engineering. While the focus is on efficiency and error reduction in iterative actions rather than the study of hard prefix prompts specifically, the principles of designing effective prompts are implicitly a part of the paper due to the need for clear and structured input to guide the LLMs' plan generation and decision-making processes. Therefore, the study is relevant to the broader context of prompt engineering, although it does not directly address a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts."
batchprompt: accomplish more with less,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract describes research focused on improving the efficiency of large language model prompting through batching strategies, specifically 'BatchPrompt.' This is highly relevant to prompt engineering as it directly tackles the challenge of optimizing prompts for better performance in terms of processing time and resource consumption, which is a core aspect of prompt engineering. The introduction of strategies like Batch Permutation and Ensembling (BPE) and Self-reflection-guided Early Stopping (SEAS) to address performance issues associated with batching denotes a significant contribution to the field. The detailed experimental results showing comparative performance with traditional single-data prompting further underscore the relevance of this study to prompt engineering. The deduction of a point from a perfect score is due to the abstract slightly broader focus on overall efficiency rather than the fine-grained specifics of prompt crafting. However, the study's outcome directly impacts prompt engineering practices for large language models."
modular and parameter-efficient multimodal fusion with prompting,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper discusses the use of prompt vectors to align modalities in multimodal fusion, which is relevant to the field of prompt engineering as it involves the use of prompts to achieve model efficiency and modularity. However, it may not directly address the exact concept of 'hard prefix prompts' as might be suggested by a 'comprehensive systematic review'. Nonetheless, the paper still contributes to the broader area of prompt engineering by exploring efficient alternatives to finetuning in multimodal pre-training, thus the rating is above average but not maximum."
attempt: parameter-efficient multi-task tuning via attentional mixtures of soft prompts,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract presents a novel approach to multi-task learning in language models that leverages soft prompts—small prefix embedding vectors—for efficient parameter tuning. Given that the study explicitly addresses prompt engineering through soft prompts and their application in multi-task learning and knowledge transfer, it is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering. The approach's efficiency and effectiveness in comparison to other tuning methods underscore its significance within the realm of prompt engineering studies. The score is not a perfect 10 because the focus is specifically on 'soft' prompts rather than 'hard' prompts as mentioned in your inquiry, suggesting a slightly wider scope than just hard prefix prompts."
effective structured prompting by meta-learning and representative verbalizer,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The provided abstract details the use of prompts in natural language processing with a focus on prompt tuning and the introduction of a new method called MetaPrompter. It relates directly to prompt engineering as it discusses the initialization of prompts, the use of meta-learning for task-specific prompts, and the creation of a more efficient system for prompt application in pre-trained MLMs. The relevance score is not a full 10 because the abstract does not specifically mention 'hard prefix prompts' which is the particular focus of the solicited comprehensive review. However, it discusses the broader field of prompt engineering and provides insights into the recent developments in prompt tuning techniques, which are pertinent to the study of hard prefix prompts."
prompting classes: exploring the power of prompt class learning in weakly supervised semantic segmentation,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The provided abstract details a study that explores prompt tuning in the context of weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), which is a specific application of prompt engineering. The focus on how the modification of text prompts can impact the Class Activation Map (CAM) and the introduction of a novel PrOmpt cLass lEarning (POLE) strategy demonstrate a direct relevance to prompt engineering as it pertains to adapting language-vision models to downstream tasks. While the study is specific to WSSS and does not cover the broader topic of 'hard prefix prompts' comprehensively, the principles and findings can contribute valuable insights into the broader field of prompt engineering, hence the high relevance rating."
rewoo: decoupling reasoning from observations for efficient augmented language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study introduces ReWOO (Reasoning WithOut Observation) which aims to make Augmented Language Models more efficient by decoupling the reasoning process from knowledge retrieval. This approach could be highly relevant to prompt engineering, especially in complex systems that require prompt optimization to reduce computational costs and improve efficiency. Since the methodology addresses issues related to prompt redundancy and token optimization, it would contribute to the design of better-engineered prompts that effectively interact with external tools without unnecessary computational overhead. However, the study does not directly focus on 'hard prefix prompts' or the systematic review of various prompt types, therefore the relevance is notable but not absolute."
efficient domain adaptation of language models via adaptive tokenization,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study discussed in the title 'efficient domain adaptation of language models via adaptive tokenization' is relevant to prompt engineering study to a significant extent. While it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts', it focuses on improving the adaptation of language models to new domains, which is a related aspect of prompt engineering. The process of optimizing tokenizer behavior for domain-specific understanding can enhance prompt responses by tailoring model input to better represent contextual nuances. This indirect relation to prompt construction and optimization reflects an underlying relevance to prompt engineering, as tokenization is a foundational component that influences the quality of prompts and their interpretation by language models. Nevertheless, the study does not directly tackle prompt engineering methodologies or the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts', thus the relevance is not maximal."
parameter-efficient low-resource dialogue state tracking by prompt tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,9,"The abstract discusses the use of soft prompt token embeddings, which is a technique within the paradigm of prompt engineering. Although it does not discuss 'hard prefix prompts' specifically, it relates closely to the topic as prompt tuning is a key area within prompt engineering studies. The research aims to enhance dialogue state tracking by using prompts to tune language models with fewer parameters, which is a direct application of prompt engineering principles.

Consequently, it has some relevance due to the mention of prompts but is not centrally focused on prompt engineering studies."
prompt-tuning in asr systems for efficient domain-adaptation,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The paper is highly relevant to the field of prompt engineering as it addresses the application of prompt-tuning, specifically within the context of domain adaptation for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. The concept of training a small number of domain-specific token embeddings to adapt a transformer-based language model is a practical example of prompt engineering. By achieving significant performance improvements with a minimal increase in parameters, the study contributes to the field by demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt-based techniques for improving model performance in specialized domains. The lower than perfect score is due to the focus on ASR systems specifically, which is a subset of prompt engineering applications, rather than the entire breadth of prompt engineering."

Since prompt engineering studies how to design and use prompts to communicate effectively with language models, the mentioned techniques of prompt transfer and the novel PANDA approach are highly relevant to the field. It focuses on the optimization and enhancement of prompts, which is a core aspect of prompt engineering. The only reason the rating is not a 10 is because the study is narrower in scope, focusing on efficiency and specific techniques rather than a broader methodological investigation into prompt design or the theory behind prompt engineering."
toward efficient language model pretraining and downstream adaptation via self-evolution: a case study on superglue,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The relevance of this study to prompt engineering is moderate to high as it discusses the 'prompt transfer technique' which is a form of prompt engineering. This technique involves transferring knowledge from one task to another, which is central to the idea of adapting language models to various downstream tasks using prompts. The study's focus on leveraging this technique to improve low-resource tasks indicates that it involves modifying or engineering prompts to enhance performance, which is pertinent to the study of prompt engineering. However, the report does not seem to specifically address 'hard prefix prompts,' which was the explicit focus mentioned in your query. Therefore, the study is relevant due to its inclusion of prompt-based techniques, but not as high as it would be if it were centered on hard prefix prompts specifically."
degree: a data-efficient generation-based event extraction model,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The study appears highly relevant to prompt engineering as it involves the design of manual prompts to guide a data-efficient event extraction model, termed DEGREE. The model's dependency on these prompts for semantic guidance indicates that a significant portion of the research likely involves understanding and improving how prompts are constructed (prompt engineering) to better capture event arguments. Although the primary focus is event extraction, the reliance on manually designed prompts for model training and the discussion of prompt-encoded information suggest a substantial relevance to the field of prompt engineering."
fedprompt: communication-efficient and privacy-preserving prompt tuning in federated learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper discusses prompt tuning within the context of federated learning, which directly relates to the broader field of prompt engineering. While it does not explicitly mention 'hard prefix prompts,' the study of prompt tuning techniques and their efficiency and privacy implications within federated learning frameworks adds to the understanding of how prompts can be optimized. Given that prompt engineering encompasses the exploration and application of prompts in various scenarios, the relevance is high. However, it is not rated a full 10 because the specific focus on communication efficiency and privacy in federated learning does not directly address the systematic review aspect of hard prefix prompts, which seems to be a more targeted area within the field of prompt engineering."
prompt tuning for parameter-efficient medical image segmentation,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"The abstract presents a study on the application of prompt tuning, a concept closely related to prompt engineering, in the context of medical image segmentation. Although the study focuses on a specific application (parameter-efficient adaptations for semantic segmentation in medical imaging), it explores the use of prompts (learnable prompt tokens) to adapt a neural network model to new tasks without full model fine-tuning. Since prompt engineering involves techniques for efficiently integrating prompts in order to steer model behavior, albeit typically in the context of language models, this work's investigation into prompts in the UNet architecture for medical imaging is relevant to the broader study of prompt engineering principles and methods. The rating is not a full 10 because the study is highly specialized and may not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' or the specificities of prompt engineering in natural language processing, which often is the primary focus of prompt engineering literature."
rethinking visual prompt learning as masked visual token modeling,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The discussed paper is relevant to the study of prompt engineering, despite its focus on the vision domain rather than natural language processing (NLP). The paper introduces a method for visual prompt learning, which parallels the concept of prompt engineering in NLP by adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. The proposal of Visual Prompt learning as Masked visual Token Modeling (VPTM) to unify the form of pre-training and downstream tasks is conceptually similar to hard prompt methods in NLP that aim to bridge the gap between the two stages. Although the specific application to visual tasks might not directly correspond to textual 'hard prefix prompts,' the underlying principles of prompting and task reformulation involved in VPTM are relevant to the broader study of prompt engineering. The emphasis on consistency, robustness, and unified deployment also echoes concerns in prompt engineering research."
parameter-efficient tuning helps language model alignment,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The given abstract presents a method for aligning language models with human preferences by using a technique called 'alignMEnt with parameter-Efficient Tuning (MEET)'. This involves optimizing control tokens using parameter-efficient tuning strategies such as prompting tuning and low-rank adaptation, which is highly relevant to prompt engineering. The reference to 'control tokens' and 'hand-crafted prompts' directly relates to the design and engineering of prompts for tuning model behavior. The focus on parameter-efficiency is also pertinent to prompt engineering because it relates to optimizing the input given to models without overhauling the entire model architecture. However, the abstract does not specifically address 'hard prefix prompts' which would be the focus of a comprehensive systematic review on that topic. For this reason, the relevance is not rated a full 10, as it is more broadly about language model alignment with control tokens rather than narrowly focused on hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering."
multimodal prompting with missing modalities for visual recognition supplementary materials,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"While the study is not specifically focused on 'hard prefix prompts', it does address the broader topic of prompt engineering in the context of multimodal learning and attention mechanisms. The research on the impact of prompt length and the layer at which the prompt is inserted is relevant to the understanding of how prompts can be optimized for improved performance in AI models. Therefore, the paper's relevance to prompt engineering is high, warranting a rating of 8. However, the exact match with the 'hard prefix prompts' focus may be lacking, hence not a full 10."

The concept of 'prompting' is central to the study. However, the focus on multimodal tasks and disentangling objectives for the vision encoder introduces specificity that is somewhat tangential to hard prefix prompts in text-based prompt engineering. While the principles of the study could potentially be applied or extended to text-based prompt engineering, the immediate relevance is somewhat indirect, hence the rating of 7."
ddcot: duty-distinct chain-of-thought prompting for multimodal reasoning in language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"While the abstract describes a study focused on multimodal reasoning and Chain of Thought (CoT) with language models, its relevance to prompt engineering lies in the novel DDCoT prompting approach which is presented. The notion of 'negative-space prompting' and tailoring prompts to encourage 'critical thinking' and proper distribution of tasks ('letting everyone do their jobs') within multimodal CoT reasoning are directly related to the design and engineering of effective prompts that enhance AI performance. Consequently, the abstract is highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering, particularly in the context of improving AI's multimodal reasoning capabilities. However, the rating is not a full 10 because it does not focus exclusively on 'hard prefix prompts' but rather on a broader set of techniques within multimodal CoT prompting, leaving some room for more specific relevance to the systematic review aspect of the provided prompt."

Although the study focuses specifically on multimodal interactions (text and image prompts) rather than purely text-based 'hard prefix prompts,' the findings and design guidelines derived from the research could be informative for prompt engineering in a broader context. The aspects of conditioning models and evaluating their performance based on input prompts are directly relevant to the techniques and methodologies of prompt engineering, hence the relatively high relevance rating."
multimodal multi-task stealth assessment for reflection-enriched game-based learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study mentioned does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' or 'prompt engineering' as it appears to be more focused on game-based learning environments and using a stealth assessment framework for educational purposes. The relevance comes from the use of in-game reflection prompts and the multifaceted assessment of student responses which tangentially touches upon the concept of prompts and reflection in learning. However, it does not engage with the specific study of engineering prompts in the context of AI systems or conversational models, which would be necessary for a higher relevance rating."
visual chain of thought: bridging logical gaps with multimodal infillings,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study introduces VCoT, which uses a form of prompt engineering by leveraging chain of thought prompting which is relevant to prompt engineering study. However, the focus is more on multimodal integration and recursive infillings to improve reasoning in sequential data, rather than on prompt engineering with hard prefixes specifically.

the smartweb corpora: multimodal access to the web in natural environments,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The description indicates that the chapter discusses a prompting scheme called SitPro, a recording technique, and properties of created corpora. While the mention of a prompting scheme suggests relevance to prompt engineering, there is no explicit mention of 'hard prefix prompts' or a systematic review approach. The relevance appears to be tangential rather than directly focused on prompt engineering as it pertains to pre-determined structured prompts. The rating reflects moderate relevance due to the connections to prompts and data acquisition which could be applicable to prompt engineering studies but lacks specificity regarding 'hard prefix prompts'."
adaptive action prompting: a complementary aid to support task-oriented interaction in explorative user interfaces,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The abstract refers to 'Adaptive action prompting,' which is closely related to prompt engineering in that it involves the system generating suggestions or prompts based on various models. This concept aligns with prompt engineering, as it requires understanding how to design and adapt prompts for optimal user interaction. However, the study seems to focus more on user interface interaction rather than the specific linguistic or conversational design of prompts. Therefore, while relevant, it may not fully delve into the 'hard prefix prompts' aspect of the prompt engineering study."
prompt tuning for generative multimodal pretrained models,gpt-4-1106-preview,8,"This abstract is quite relevant to prompt engineering as it discusses 'prompt tuning', which is a specific method within the broader area of prompt engineering. Prompt tuning is a new paradigm where prompts are specifically crafted or optimized to improve the performance of pretrained models on various tasks. The focus on generative multimodal pretrained models suggests that the study addresses complex scenarios where prompt engineering could be crucial for model tuning. Despite the high relevance, the rating is not a complete 10 because the study seems to be more focused on implementing prompt tuning as a lightweight alternative to full model finetuning, rather than a comprehensive systematic review of hard prefix prompts as the original prompt might suggest."
opal: multimodal image generation for news illustration,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper's focus on a system named Opal that navigates the challenges of finding the right visual language for text prompts does relate to prompt engineering, particularly in multimodal AI contexts. Although the paper does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' it does deal with the structured creation of text prompts to guide AI in generating images, which is an essential part of prompt engineering. The relevance is high because prompt engineering is critical for effective human-AI co-creation, especially in text-to-image generation tasks. However, the paper centers more on the application of such a system for news illustrations rather than the theoretical or methodological aspects of prompt engineering study."
draw your art dream: diverse digital art synthesis with multimodal guided diffusion,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper presented addresses the usage of multimodal prompts which involve feeding a model with inputs from different modalities such as text and image, which aligns with the concept of 'prompt engineering' that typically involves crafting inputs to guide a model’s output. Although not directly focused on 'hard prefix prompts', the concept of using complex, multimodal inputs for guiding a diffusion model in digital art synthesis demonstrates advanced prompt techniques and is indirectly related to the engineering of prompts to achieve desired outcomes in AI systems. Hence, there is a significant relevance to prompt engineering, but it is not a perfect match as the primary study is not about hard prefix prompts in the context of systematic reviews."

lvp-m3: language-aware visual prompt for multilingual multimodal machine translation,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The paper introduces a model LVP-M3 that utilizes visual prompts for the task of Multilingual Multimodal Machine Translation. While the study focuses primarily on translation and the integration of visual features for understanding context across multiple languages, the concept of 'visual prompts' does relate to the idea of 'prompt engineering' as it involves designing inputs to improve the machine's understanding and performance. Although these visual prompts are not 'hard prefix prompts' explicitly, the process of generating and utilizing prompts to enhance model performance overlaps with the broader theme of prompt engineering. Thus, the relevance is significant but not directly focused on the systematic study of hard prefix prompts, hence the rating of 7."
few-shot multimodal sentiment analysis based on multimodal probabilistic fusion prompts,gpt-4-1106-preview,7,"The study addresses prompt engineering to some extent by introducing a novel method that includes the design of 'unified multimodal prompts' to decrease discrepancies between different modalities in the few-shot sentiment analysis. This involves engineering prompts that cater to more than just textual data, integrating multimodal data which is a unique and relevant approach to prompt engineering. Additionally, the concept of 'probabilistic fusion method to fuse output predictions from multiple diverse prompts' indicates an advanced level of prompt engineering where different prompts and their predictions are combined. However, the study focuses more specifically on multimodal sentiment analysis and few-shot learning, rather than solely on prompt engineering or 'hard prefix prompts' as stated in the initial topic. Therefore, it is not exclusively aligned with the concept of 'hard prefix prompts' in prompt engineering studies but still significantly contributes to the broader domain of prompt engineering."
beyond bounding box: multimodal knowledge learning for object detection,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The paper deals with the use of language prompts for improving object detection in machine learning, indicating relevance to prompt engineering in that it involves designing prompts to facilitate learning.
