incremental prompting: episodic memory prompt for lifelong event detection,7,"The presented abstract is relevant to prompt engineering study to a considerable extent because it introduces 'Episodic Memory Prompts (EMP)', which is a technique relevant to prompt engineering. It contributes to the field by addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting and suggesting a prompt-based method to retain task-specific knowledge in a model that is being continually updated. This is pertinent as it deals with prompt optimization and its role in lifelong learning, both of which fall under the broad umbrella of prompt engineering.

While the study is not specifically about 'prompt engineering', the use of 'hard triplet questions' and 'carefully designed pairwise questions' indicates a deliberate and strategic approach to crafting prompts to achieve specific outcomes from the language model. This shows relevance to the study of prompt engineering, as the effectiveness of ClusterLLM relies on the proper construction of these prompts to guide the clustering process. However, the application is specific to text clustering rather than prompt engineering in general, which is why the rating is not closer to 10.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14871

Although prompt engineering typically involves refining input prompts to achieve better performance in language models, the abstract describes a system that takes text and prompt audio as input to control speech attributes like emotion and pitch. This relates to a form of prompt engineering where the prompt is not just textual but also auditory. The mention of 'tokens in the style embedding matrix' also suggests a relationship with prompt engineering as it implies the manipulation of specific elements to guide the model's output.

llama-adapter: efficient fine-tuning of language models with zero-init attention,7,"The abstract describes the development of a method for fine-tuning language models using a set of learnable adaption prompts, which is relevant to prompt engineering, particularly in the context of instruction-following models. The integration of these prompts into the higher transformer layers is a technique related to prompt engineering as it involves modifying the input sequence to achieve a desired behavior from the model. However, the study seems to be more focused on an efficient fine-tuning mechanism rather than on the specifics of designing prompts (hard prefixes), so it is not a perfect match to prompt engineering studies that focus exclusively on hard prefix prompts. Therefore, the rating acknowledges the relevance of the learnable adaption prompts but is not a full 10 due to the broader scope of the study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16199

This indicates some relevance to prompt engineering as it pertains to the use of prompts to guide the decoder in image processing tasks. However, the term 'prompt-based learning' in this context is more related to the domain of image restoration rather than to the development and study of textual or linguistic prompts in AI and machine learning. Even though the technique involves 'prompts' in some form, it may not specifically address the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' as one might expect in the study of AI or natural language processing.

While this approach does utilize 'prompts' in the form of medical queries to improve the model's understanding of free-text EHR data, these prompts do not appear to be 'hard prefix prompts' in the context of prompting techniques typically discussed in natural language processing (NLP). The focus of the study is not on exploring the design or effectiveness of various prompts but rather on the application of medical prompts to harmonize different data modalities for medical predictions.
