align and prompt: video-and-language pre-training with entity prompts,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract describes a pre-training framework for video-and-language tasks, focusing on cross-modal alignment and introducing a novel prompting entity modeling concept. Although the study involves 'entity prompts,' it primarily concentrates on video-text interaction rather than exploring 'hard prefix prompts' as may be suggested by prompt engineering in a language model context. The relevance to prompt engineering is secondary and indirect, mainly connected through the novel use of prompts for entity modeling within a multimodal framework, not as a comprehensive study of prompt engineering itself."
why do pretrained language models help in downstream tasks? an analysis of head and prompt tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper's abstract describes an analysis of head tuning and prompt tuning, which are highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering as a concept. Prompt tuning particularly involves the process of adjusting prompts to achieve better performance in downstream tasks, which is a subset of prompt engineering. However, the abstract suggests a specific focus on the theoretical underpinnings of why pretrained language models are effective, using generative models like HMMs for analysis. The relevance to prompt engineering is therefore significant but not completely aligned, as it does not explicitly address the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' or the practical aspect of designing prompts, which might be expected from a 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts'."
modeling prompt adherence in student essays,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study is only moderately relevant to prompt engineering. It focuses on modeling prompt adherence in student essays and introduces a corpus and scoring method, which could potentially inform the development of prompts in educational settings. However, prompt adherence is just one aspect of prompt engineering, and the study's scope is limited to student essays rather than a broader application within engineering prompts for AI or human-computer interactions. Therefore, while relevant, it does not wholly represent prompt engineering as a comprehensive field."
how novices use llm-based code generators to solve cs1 coding tasks in a self-paced learning environment,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the presented study does not directly focus on 'hard prefix prompts' or prompt engineering, it does investigate the use of prompts by novice programmers in an educational setting when interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generator like Codex. Since prompt crafting is a substantial part of this interaction, and the properties of these prompts are analyzed, the study has some relevance to prompt engineering. However, its primary focus seems to be on the educational implications and usage patterns of the LLM rather than developing or understanding the specific prompt engineering strategies to improve interaction with LLMs."
"reason for future, act for now: a principled framework for autonomous llm agents with provable sample efficiency",gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The abstract provided discusses a framework for improving the way large language models act and reason over time, with a focus on learning and planning within Bayesian adaptive Markov decision processes. Although this is related to how prompts might be engineered to elicit particular responses from LLMs, it doesn't specifically mention 'hard prefix prompts' or address prompt engineering techniques in a systematic review context. Therefore, while aspects of this framework could potentially inform prompt engineering strategies to some extent (hence not a 0 rating), the relevance to the study of prompt engineering, particularly that of 'hard prefix prompts,' is only tangentially related. Therefore, a middle score reflects this partial relevance."
hide and seek (has): a lightweight framework for prompt privacy protection,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The provided abstract focuses on privacy protection in the context of using large language models by introducing the HaS (Hide and Seek) framework, which is relevant to the broader field of responsible AI usage and prompt engineering to a certain degree. It discusses techniques for anonymization and de-anonymization, which could indirectly affect the way prompts are engineered to ensure privacy. However, the main concern of the study is privacy protection rather than methodologies for optimizing or understanding the construction of prompts (hard prefix prompts) in prompt engineering studies. As a result, it holds moderate relevance as it touches upon the privacy aspect of user inputs (prompts) but does not directly deal with the study or advancement of prompt-engineering techniques."
gpt-3-driven pedagogical agents for training children's curious question-asking skills,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The relevance to prompt engineering study is moderate. While the focus of this paper appears to be on using large language models to encourage children to ask more curious questions, and it involves a natural language prompting approach, the connection to 'hard prefix prompts' specifically is not directly mentioned. Prompt engineering is certainly a component of training these models for pedagogical purposes, but the abstract does not provide information about a systematic review of prompt engineering or hard prefix prompts explicitly. It suggests using prompting methods for practical applications rather than studying the prompts themselves."
surreal vr pong: llm approach to game design,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The title and abstract provided discuss the application of generative models and computational creativity in the context of 3D game design and propose the integration of prompt-based creation into the gameplay itself. While it does not specifically focus on 'hard prefix prompts,' it does touch on prompt engineering by suggesting that prompts can be an element within game mechanics. This indicates some relevance to the study of prompt engineering, but it is not a direct or comprehensive examination of hard prefix prompts in systematic reviews or other studies."
reconcile: round-table conference improves reasoning via consensus among diverse llms,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study presents a multi-agent system for improving consensus and reasoning among Large Language Models (LLMs), which touches on the field of prompt engineering indirectly through the use of 'discussion prompts'. While it does not address hard prefix prompts directly, the mention of prompts as a means for agent communication suggests relevance to prompt design and its impact on model performance. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to studies in prompt engineering, especially those exploring the interaction dynamics and prompt-response behavior within and between models."
prompting large language models for zero-shot domain adaptation in speech recognition,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract touches on using a domain-specific text prompt for zero-shot domain adaptation in speech recognition with a large language model, which involves prompt engineering for a narrowly defined purpose. It highlights utilizing prompts for performance improvement in a specific AI task, which is relevant to the study of prompt engineering. However, it does not directly address a 'systematic review on hard prefix prompts' or cover the broader implications and methodologies of prompt engineering, thus only partially relevant."
interactive data synthesis for systematic vision adaptation via llms-aigcs collaboration,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract provided for the study 'interactive data synthesis for systematic vision adaptation via llms-aigcs collaboration' indicates an exploration of the collaboration between language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) models for more controllable image generation, which is aligned with the practice of prompt engineering. However, the focus seems to be on data augmentation for vision tasks rather than solely on the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' in prompt engineering. Although prompt engineering is relevant to the work described, as it is necessary for guiding the LLMs in this process, the absence of a direct and explicit focus on a review of prompt engineering techniques, specifically hard prefix prompts, results in a moderate rating on the relevance scale."
systematic rectification of language models via dead-end analysis,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study presents a method for detoxification of language model outputs, which is tangentially related to prompt engineering. While the main focus is not on the development of prompts, the detoxification process could impact how prompts are engineered by reducing the probability of generating toxic responses and altering the token selection process. This can be relevant in creating safer and more effective prompts. However, the study does not directly address hard prefix prompts or systematic reviews of prompt engineering strategies, so the rating reflects moderate relevance rather than full alignment with the prompt engineering field."
chatrule: mining logical rules with large language models for knowledge graph reasoning,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The described paper presents a novel framework called ChatRule, which utilizes large language models to generate logical rules for knowledge graph reasoning. While this application indirectly relates to prompt engineering, as it involves leveraging LLMs to generate content based on structured prompts from knowledge graphs, the focus is more on the application in knowledge graphs and logical rule mining rather than on the study of hard prefix prompts in a general context. Therefore, its relevance to a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering may be considered moderate, as the principles could potentially inform prompt engineering techniques, but it is not directly aligned with the review's core subject."
zero-shot prompting for code complexity prediction using github copilot,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The relevance of this study to prompt engineering is somewhat indirect. The study investigates the capacity of GitHub Copilot, which leverages a Large Language Model, to predict code complexity in a zero-shot manner. While this addresses the model's ability to understand and generate responses in a specific technical domain without prior training, it does not directly explore the engineering or optimization of prompts (i.e., hard prefix prompts). However, the study does touch on a key aspect of prompt-based interactions with AI, which is the model's performance on tasks with no fine-tuning. This suggests relevance in terms of understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLMs like GPT3 when prompted with untrained tasks, which is a component of prompt engineering."
investigating causal understanding in llms,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study discussed in the abstract is only partially relevant to prompt engineering since the investigation focuses on the causal understanding capabilities of LLMs rather than specifically on 'hard prefix prompts.' However, the research touches on how varying prompt presentations can affect LLM responses, which is related to the concept of prompt engineering. The relevance lies in understanding the influence of presentation form, both in hard prefix prompts and other types of prompting. The rating is not higher because the study does not directly focus on 'hard prefix prompts,' which seems to be the specific area of interest."
evaluating the text-to-sql capabilities of large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract describes an empirical study on the capability of a language model, Codex, to interpret and convert natural language into SQL queries. The study focuses on performance evaluation and comparison with state-of-the-art models in terms of few-shot learning, which is facilitated by providing a few in-domain examples in the prompt. Although the abstract does not explicitly mention the term 'prompt engineering,' the essence of evaluating the impact of tailored prompts on the model's performance is captured in the process of providing 'in-domain examples'. This could be considered a form of prompt engineering, as it involves crafting prompts to improve task-specific performance. Hence, the study has relevance to the broader field of prompt engineering, specifically regarding how prompts can enable large language models to understand and generate structured queries like SQL. However, the focus is not on 'hard prefix prompts' or a comprehensive systematic review on such, which would be more directly related to the prompt engineering study described in the prompt, thus warranting a moderate rating rather than a high one."
persistent anti-muslim bias in large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"While the study is highly relevant to the broader field of AI ethics and bias in machine learning models, its direct relevance to 'prompt engineering' is moderate. It touches on the concept of 'adversarial text prompts' as a means to counteract bias in language models, which does fall under the scope of prompt engineering. However, the study's primary focus is on the identification and analysis of bias, rather than on the engineering of prompts as a method for directing or improving the language model's outputs. More specifically, it does not address 'hard prefix prompts' in the systematic review sense but does explore the dynamic between prompt construction and model responses related to bias."
augesc: dialogue augmentation with large language models for emotional support conversation,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study described does involve prompts as it discusses leveraging large language models for dialogue augmentation, specifically in the context of emotional support conversation. The prompt engineering aspect is present in the sense that the researchers instruct the model to complete dialogues which could be considered a form of a 'prompt'. However, hard prefix prompts, which imply a specific approach to structuring prompts to elicit desired responses, are not directly mentioned. This suggests that while the study is related to prompt design and usage, it may not focus on the 'hard prefix prompts' aspect extensively, leading to a moderate relevance rating."
retroformer: retrospective large language agents with policy gradient optimization,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract describes a study related to optimizing large language agents through policy gradient optimization, which indirectly involves engineering of prompts because it mentions the automatic tuning of language agent prompts based on environment feedback. While this does not specifically target 'hard prefix prompts,' it is relevant to the broader field of prompt engineering as it involves refining prompts to improve agent performance. However, the lack of direct mention of 'hard prefix prompts' or a comprehensive systematic review of them justifies a moderate rating rather than a high one."
leveraging large language models for mental health prediction via online text data,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The title and abstract indicate that this study involves leveraging large language models (LLMs) for mental health prediction tasks by analyzing online text data, which is related to the application of LLMs, but it doesn't specifically mention 'hard prefix prompts' or 'prompt engineering' as the central theme. However, the use of zero-shot and few-shot prompting, along with instruction finetuning, falls under the broader category of prompt engineering techniques. Therefore, while the study is tangentially relevant to prompt engineering because it involves designing inputs for LLMs to perform specific tasks, it is not focused on a comprehensive systematic review of hard prefix prompts, which makes it only moderately relevant."
can large language models empower molecular property prediction?,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study focuses on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for molecular property prediction using SMILES text, which demonstrates a use case for LLMs that is adjacent to the concept of prompt engineering. Although it deals with prompting LLMs for in-context learning and involves the generation of explanations, which are relevant techniques in prompt engineering, the study's primary aim is not a systematic review of prompt engineering itself, nor does it specifically address 'hard prefix prompts'. Therefore, its relevance to a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts is tangentially related but not directly aligned, warranting a moderate relevance rating."
generating data for symbolic language with large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract indicates that the paper is closely related to the use of prompts in the context of LLMs for data generation, specifically in the area of symbolic language tasks. While the study does not directly focus on 'hard prefix prompts' as stipulated in the prompt engineering study question, it does explore 'informative prompt' design in order to steer the LLM's data generation process. This suggests a strong relevance to the practice of prompt engineering and the optimization of prompts for specific tasks in LLMs. However, the lack of explicit focus on 'hard prefix prompts' reduces the direct relevance to the systematic review concerning that specific aspect of prompt engineering."
quantifying memorization across neural language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the abstract discusses the issue of memorization in language models, which is indirectly related to how models respond to prompts, it does not directly address prompt engineering, particularly the study of 'hard prefix prompts.' The information provided is relevant to the construction and reliability of prompts in the context of avoiding the elicitation of memorized data, but it does not specifically focus on engineering prompts for systematic review that the original query suggests. Therefore, the relevance is moderate but not directly applicable to the study of hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering."
denseclip: language-guided dense prediction with context-aware prompting,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the study described in the abstract does involve a form of 'prompting' by using contextual language information to guide a model, this is applied in the scope of visual representation learning and not in the explicit context of 'hard prefix prompts' for text-based language models, which is often what is referred to in prompt engineering studies. Therefore, its relevance to prompt engineering study is tangential rather than directly applicable."
speechprompt v2: prompt tuning for speech classification tasks,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper is relevant to prompt engineering as it discusses prompt tuning, a technique integral to prompt engineering that involves fine-tuning a language model (LM) using prompts to better perform specific tasks. Although the main focus is on speech classification tasks and not solely on hard prefix prompts, it still offers insights into the larger field of prompt engineering, particularly how prompts are used to improve performance and efficiency for various tasks in speech processing. The paper does not directly address a 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts,' but the technology it explores falls within the broader scope of prompt engineering studies."
prompting visual-language models for efficient video understanding,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study pertains to efficient adaptation mechanisms for pre-trained visual-language models specifically for video understanding tasks. It suggests a methodology for fine-tuning the models, possibly including the use of prompts to align pre-training objectives with video-related tasks. While it doesn't directly address 'hard prefix prompts', the adaptation of pre-trained models using prompts is a related area of research. The relevance is therefore moderate, as the study could potentially inform prompt engineering practices in multi-modal contexts, even though it does not focus on a systematic review of hard prefix prompts."
reducing sentiment bias in language models via counterfactual evaluation,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study deals with reducing sentiment bias in language models by using a form of counterfactual evaluation, which is related to how prompts might internalize biases present in training data. While it touches on the area of prompt engineering by considering how the conditioning context affects model output, its primary focus is on bias quantification and reduction rather than on the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' or the structure and impact of prompt design itself."
simultaneous translation and paraphrase for language education,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study presents work on the generation of translations and paraphrases, which touches upon prompt engineering indirectly through the creation of diverse language sets for training models. However, the primary focus appears to be on translation and paraphrasing rather than prompt engineering itself. It can be relevant to prompt engineering in the context of designing effective prompts for language translation tasks but does not directly address the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' for prompt engineering studies."
generative visual prompt: unifying distributional control of pre-trained generative models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study presents a framework called Generative Visual Prompt (PromptGen) to exercise distributional control over pre-trained generative models. While it does not directly relate to 'hard prefix prompts' that are typically associated with language models and their prompting techniques, the concept of manipulating the output of generative models using prompts (here in the form of external model knowledge) is related to the broader topic of prompt engineering. The focus on controlling generative models aligns with the idea of influencing model behavior through prompts, hence the relevance to the field of prompt engineering. However, it lacks a direct connection to 'hard prefix prompts' in systematic review context and instead deals with a different application of prompting in the visual domain. Thus, the relevance is moderate, and the rating is given a 6."
dream3d: zero-shot text-to-3d synthesis using 3d shape prior and text-to-image diffusion models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The paper discusses the use of text prompts for zero-shot text-to-3D synthesis, which involves aspects of prompt engineering as it requires the optimization of text prompts to generate 3D shapes. However, the core focus is on the synthesis of 3D structures from text descriptions rather than on the study of hard prefix prompts specifically. The relevance to prompt engineering is tangential and mainly related to optimizing text prompts within a specific context of 3D content generation."
unleashing the power of visual prompting at the pixel level,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper describes a study focused on visual prompting as a technique to adapt pre-trained models for recognition tasks, which is related to prompting in a broad sense. However, the query asks for a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts, which typically refers to textual prompt engineering where specific text prompts are designed to guide language models. Although visual prompting shares similar goals in terms of adapting models to new tasks, it does so in the domain of images rather than text. Hence, the relevance is moderate because the methods and outcomes may have conceptual parallels to textual prompt engineering, but do not directly address or review hard text-based prefix prompts."
being comes from not-being: open-vocabulary text-to-motion generation with wordless training,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the abstract indicates that this study was inspired by prompt learning in NLP and involves the reformulation of input text into a 'prompt' for a generator, the primary focus is on text-to-motion generation rather than on prompt engineering for language models or systematic reviews of 'hard prefix prompts.' The connection to prompt engineering is tangential and based more on a conceptual inspiration than on a direct study or analysis of prompts in the context of text or language processing."
a web-based environment for documentation and sharing of engineering design knowledge,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The abstract describes an ontological knowledge-base designed to aid in the engineering design process by prompting engineers to document and share information efficiently. Although it mentions the use of prompts to drive certain behaviors within the engineering design process, the focus is not specifically on the study of 'hard prefix prompts' in the context of 'prompt engineering' as it relates to AI or machine learning. The paper seems to be more aligned with knowledge management and ontological structures in engineering rather than the specific study of designing and engineering prompts for AI systems. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant due to its use of prompting mechanisms but not directly concerned with the study at hand."
what initiates evidence‐based reasoning?: situations that prompt students to support their design ideas and decisions,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The document is somewhat relevant to the study of prompt engineering as it discusses the situations that lead students to use evidence-based reasoning, which is an important factor in understanding how to structure prompts to elicit informed responses. Although it focuses on evidence-based reasoning in the context of engineering education rather than the specific area of 'hard prefix prompts', understanding the broader principles of how prompts can initiate certain types of thinking is pertinent to prompt engineering."
a prompt-aware neural network approach to content-based scoring of non-native spontaneous speech,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study focuses on using neural network techniques to assess non-native spontaneous speech, which includes using prompts as a condition for the model. Although this involves engineering a model to interact with prompts, the core emphasis is on automatic assessment rather than on the systematic review or deep exploration of 'hard prefix prompts', which would be central to prompt engineering studies. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as it only touches on prompt-related aspects within a broader application context."
how do different reflection prompts affect engineering students’ academic performance and engagement?,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract describes a study that relates to prompt engineering in the educational sense and not in the AI field. It addresses the effectiveness of different types of reflection prompts (generic versus specific) on students' performance and engagement in an engineering course context. While it is not directly about the engineering of AI-based prompt systems, the insights regarding how specificity in prompts can influence outcomes may be partially relevant to the nuances involved in designing prompts for AI systems. However, the primary focus of the study on academic performance and engagement of engineering students limits the relevance to prompt engineering in AI. Thus, the rating reflects moderate relevance due to indirect connections that could be drawn between educational prompting strategies and AI prompt design considerations."
v2p: vision-to-prompt based multi-modal product summary generation,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper presents a multi-modal product summary generation framework that uses a Generative Pre-trained Language Model with prompts derived from visual attributes, which aligns with the concept of prompt engineering in the sense that it involves designing prompts for guiding text generation. However, the focus seems to be more on the multi-modal interaction and summary generation, rather than on the systematic study of hard prefixes or prompt structures themselves. Therefore, while it is relevant due to its use of prompts, it may not directly address the nuances of prompt engineering as pertains to hard prefix prompts specifically, hence the rating of 6."
"don’t prompt, search! mining-based zero-shot learning with language models",gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper discusses the limitation of the traditional prompt-based approach for zero-shot learning with language models and offers an alternative mining-based approach. It touches upon the subject of how prompts are used and their sensitivity to the task, which is relevant to prompt engineering studies. However, the primary focus seems to be on the mining technique rather than the engineering or optimization of prompts themselves. Therefore, while it relates to the field of prompt engineering, it does so from a perspective of finding an alternative to hard-coded prompts, rather than improving or systematically reviewing them."
prompt-tuned code language model as a neural knowledge base for type inference in statically-typed partial code,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study presents an approach that incorporates elements of prompt engineering by fine-tuning a language model with a specific task-oriented prompt ('pre-train, prompt and predict' paradigm). Although the primary focus is not on prompt engineering for natural language processing, but rather type inference within code, the use of prompts to guide the model suggests relevance. However, it is specialized for code language models which may not fully align with more generalized prompt engineering studies."
prompt deep light-weight vessel segmentation network (plvs-net),gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The relevance to prompt engineering in this study is moderate. The use of 'prompt blocks' within the network architecture indicates an innovation related to how the network processes information, which might be relevant to prompt engineering in the broader sense of designing inputs that improve the performance of a neural network. However, the primary focus appears to be on biomedical image segmentation, rather than the development or study of prompting methods for natural language processing or other general AI applications. Thus, while the term 'prompt' is used, it may not directly align with the typical context of prompt engineering, which is often related to improving AI responses or behavior based on textual input."
the utility of an evidence-based lecture and clinical prompt as methods to improve quality of care in colorectal cancer screening,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study appears to investigate the effectiveness of clinical prompts in a medical setting, which tangentially relates to the concept of prompt engineering. While not directly studying 'hard prefix prompts' or prompt engineering for AI or computational systems, the principle of using prompts to improve performance outcomes has some relevance to the broader field of study. However, the specific application to colorectal cancer screening and the focus on evidence-based lectures differentiates this from the typical context of prompt engineering in technology, which usually refers to the designing of inputs to elicit desired responses from AI models or systems."
blended diffusion for text-driven editing of natural images,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper's relevance to prompt engineering is moderate as it deals with the application of language prompts in the context of image editing. Even though the main focus is on the use of natural language prompts to direct image edits, which is related to how prompts are engineered to guide machine learning models, it is not specifically focused on the study of 'hard prefix prompts' or the structure and efficacy of prompts in a general sense. The relevance comes from the intersection with prompt engineering in the domain of combining text prompts with image processing models, which may offer insights into how to better design prompts for specific tasks like image editing. However, without a direct analysis on the design, structure, or impact of the prompts themselves, its relevance is not maximal."
cora: adapting clip for open-vocabulary detection with region prompting and anchor pre-matching,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract describes an approach to improve open-vocabulary detection by using region prompting in combination with a visual-language model, which could be relevant to prompt engineering in that it involves the adaptation of prompts to improve recognition tasks. However, the focus is on object detection and adapting existing models to new tasks, rather than investigating the systematic study of hard prefix prompts specifically. While the method of region prompting could potentially inform prompt engineering practices, the direct relevance to the study of hard prefix prompts is tangential."
information and communication technology based prompting for treatment compliance for people with serious mental illness.,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The provided abstract discusses the use of ICT-based prompting to improve treatment compliance in people with serious mental illness, which aligns with the broader concept of 'prompts' in behavior modification. However, the term 'hard prefix prompts' typically refers to a specific approach in natural language processing or AI-related prompt engineering, which is not the focus of this study. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as it deals with prompts in a different context than what 'prompt engineering study' typically would imply in technological or AI research."
bloom+1: adding language support to bloom for zero-shot prompting,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The provided document abstract pertains to language model adaptation, specifically for the BLOOM model, and how it is applied to zero-shot prompting in new languages. While the study addresses issues relevant to language models and prompting, it does not directly deal with the engineering of prompts, especially with 'hard prefix prompts' as mentioned in the original query. The relevance lies in the broader context of zero-shot learning and language adaptation, which can impact the effectiveness of prompts in multiple languages. However, since it doesn't focus on the specific design or structuring of prompts, or the concept of 'hard prefix prompts', the rating is moderately low."
using simple technology to prompt multistep tasks in the home for people with dementia: an exploratory study comparing prompting formats,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The study provides insights into the design of prompts for a specific user group (people with dementia) and highlights that the effectiveness of prompts can be context-dependent, which offers a partial relevance to the general field of prompt engineering. However, the study is focused on cognitive impairment and lacks a direct connection to the broader concepts and methodologies of engineering prompts for software or AI interactions. Therefore, the relevance is moderate."
large language models are state-of-the-art evaluators of translation quality,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The study focuses on the use of large language models for evaluating translation quality, which indirectly relates to prompt engineering through the application of zero-shot prompting and comparison of prompt variants. However, it is more centered on the application of language models for translation assessments rather than the principles or effects of prompt engineering itself. Although understanding how different prompts impact the quality evaluation by a language model is relevant, the core of the study is translation quality assessment rather than prompt engineering."
virtual prompt pre-training for prototype-based few-shot relation extraction,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the title suggests the study involves 'virtual prompt pre-training', which pertains to a technique potentially related to prompt engineering in the context of machine learning, the lack of abstract and TLDR makes it difficult to assess its direct relevance to prompt engineering, particularly to 'hard prefix prompts'. The relevance is expected to be moderate as it mentions prototypes and few-shot relation extraction which may involve prompt design but does not explicitly focus on hard prefix prompts as per the provided information."
visual prompt tuning for few-shot text classification,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper abstract introduces a novel method of Visual Prompt Tuning for few-shot text classification that utilizes vision-language pre-training models, which is somewhat relevant to prompt engineering as it involves a form of prompt tuning. However, the primary focus is on incorporating visual elements rather than exclusively on texts or verbal prompts, which traditionally constitute 'prompt engineering' in language models. The relevance rating is given a moderate score because it deals with tuning aspects pertinent to the deployment of large-scale language models, although it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' as described in the original study topic."
augprompt: knowledgeable augmented-trigger prompt for few-shot event classification,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The title suggests that the study is related to prompt engineering as it mentions 'augmented-trigger prompt' which implies a method of prompt design for enhanced performance in an NLP task (few-shot event classification). However, without an abstract or TLDR, it is challenging to assess the depth of relevance to prompt engineering, hence a middle-of-the-road rating is given. More information would be required for a more accurate rating."
prompt-based self-training framework for few-shot named entity recognition,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The title suggests the study involves 'prompt-based' methodology, which is relevant to prompt engineering. However, without more information from the abstract or TLDR, it's challenging to determine the extent of relevance to hard prefix prompts specifically. The study focuses on few-shot named entity recognition, which may involve prompts, but it is unclear how systematically the prompts are reviewed or engineered in the study. A neutral score reflects this partial relevance based on the information provided."
zero- and few-shot event detection via prompt-based meta learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study discusses a meta-learning framework for zero- and few-shot event detection, employing cloze-based prompts within the methodology. Prompt-based approaches are relevant to prompt engineering, as they involve the design of input structures that facilitate model learning and generalization to new tasks. However, the focus on event detection and a meta-learning framework makes this work only partially related to the core study of hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering, hence the rating is moderate."
few-shot composition learning for image retrieval with prompt tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study includes techniques related to prompt tuning and the development of a visual prompt within the context of image retrieval, which is indirectly related to prompt engineering in natural language processing (NLP). While prompt tuning is a concept used in NLP, this study applies it to a visual domain and focuses on compositional learning and few-shot learning mechanisms, which are somewhat tangential to the typical studies on hard prefix prompts in text-based models. The relevance is moderate because the study does show the application of prompt tuning concepts but in a different domain and does not directly address hard prefix prompts in the context of NLP."
balanced distributed augmentation for multi-label few shot learning with prototypical network,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract indicates that the study involves novel pipeline for automating the prompt generation, which is somewhat relevant to prompt engineering, particularly if the automated generation includes what could be considered 'hard prefix prompts.' However, the main focus of the paper appears to be on data augmentation techniques and sentiment analysis for few-shot learning rather than directly on prompt engineering. The relevance is therefore moderate and not the primary emphasis of the research."
structure pretraining and prompt tuning for knowledge graph transfer,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract describes a study on a knowledge graph pretraining model (KGTransformer) and its application across different knowledge graph-related tasks, which is related to machine learning and transfer learning. The use of 'prompt-tuning' with task data as a 'triple prompt' indicates a form of prompt engineering, but the focus seems to be more on the application of this mechanism for task-specific KG interactions, rather than a comprehensive study of the prompt engineering concept itself. The relevance to prompt engineering study is therefore present but not central to the paper's core contribution, hence the moderate rating."
[cls] token is all you need for zero-shot semantic segmentation,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The given abstract pertains to a study on zero-shot semantic segmentation using [CLS] tokens from the CLIP model, which isn't directly related to prompt engineering.

satisfiability-aided language models using declarative prompting,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract details a novel approach to improve reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by using a satisfiability-aided language modeling (SatLM). Although it does not specifically mention 'hard prefix prompts' or 'prompt engineering,' the integration of an automated theorem prover to enhance the model's problem-solving abilities indirectly relates to the broader field of prompt engineering, where devising the right prompts to elicit desired outcomes from language models is crucial. The approach of generating a declarative task specification could be seen as part of the prompt engineering process, since it involves guiding the LLM to produce useful outputs for theorem proving. However, the lack of explicit focus on prompt engineering techniques limits the relevance to a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts, thus warranting a middling score."
query expansion by prompting large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract describes using various prompts, including Chain-of-Thought, in the context of query expansion leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The relevance to prompt engineering is clear since it specifically mentions the study of different types of prompts to optimize the performance of LLMs in a search-related task. However, it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' indicating a comprehensive systematic review on a subset of prompt engineering but not covering the full scope that might be suggested by the prompt 'a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts.' Therefore, while it is relevant due to its focus on prompt types and their effect on LLMs, it's not exactly aligned with the outlined study of hard prefix prompts."
how is chatgpt's behavior changing over time?,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The provided abstract and TLDR focus on the changes in the behavior of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 over time across various tasks. While it is not directly related to a 'systematic review on hard prefix prompts' in prompt engineering, the study's insights into the performance variability and amenity to different prompting techniques (like chain-of-thought prompting) have indirect relevance to prompt engineering. Knowing how model performance can change over time is valuable for designing and updating prompts to maintain or improve LLMs' effectiveness. However, the focus is not specifically on prompt engineering with hard prefixes, which would make the relevance partial and thus results in a moderate rating."
gpt-ner: named entity recognition via large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The relevance to 'prompt engineering study' is moderate. While the abstract discusses a method to adapt large language models (LLMs) for named entity recognition (NER) by transforming it into a text generation task, which implicitly involves engineering prompts (special tokens @@##) for entity extraction, the main focus is on overcoming the shortcomings of LLMs for NER tasks and not specifically on the study of prompt engineering as a field. The self-verification strategy mentioned does relate to the usage of prompts to verify generated content, which is relevant, but the paper does not seem to be centered on prompt engineering as a comprehensive topic."
adaptive test generation using a large language model,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The relevance to prompt engineering study is moderate. While the abstract discusses the use of a Large Language Model (Codex) for automated test generation, which involves prompting the model with certain inputs to produce desired outputs (tests in this case), the study is focused on practical application rather than a systematic review of prompt engineering techniques or the study of 'hard prefix prompts' specifically. The process involves an adaptive prompting mechanism to improve test generation, which is somewhat related to prompt engineering studies. Therefore, the relevance is rated a 5, as it addresses some elements of prompt design but does not specifically target a comprehensive review or study of prompt engineering methodologies."
on the risk of misinformation pollution with large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the paper addresses the use of large language models for generating misinformation and explores defensive strategies such as prompting, it is not specifically focused on prompt engineering study with regards to hard prefix prompts.

However, as the paper's primary focus is on the deployment and effects of an educational tool rather than the systematic review of prompt engineering techniques, it is not rated higher."
reviewergpt? an exploratory study on using large language models for paper reviewing,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in the context of scientific paper reviewing, which requires sophisticated prompting strategies, it does not specifically focus on 'hard prefix prompts' as the main subject of investigation. The relevance to prompt engineering is present as the research touches upon how different prompts can lead to different performance outcomes by the LLM (e.g., prompting with specific questions versus general review requests). However, since the core study does not concentrate on the engineering of prompts and their systematic review but rather on the application of LLMs in a specific task of paper reviewing, the rating is moderately relevant rather than highly relevant."
graphologue: exploring large language model responses with interactive diagrams,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study is relevant to prompt engineering to a moderate degree. It does not directly deal with hard prefix prompts but explores the broader area of improving interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) using novel prompting strategies and interface designs. By introducing an interactive system, Graphologue, which converts LLM responses into diagrams, it touches upon enhancing the efficacy of prompts and the ways in which users can solicit and handle information from an LLM. The connection to prompt engineering lies in the fact that extracting entities and relationships for diagrams requires careful prompt design to ensure that the LLM provides structured responses suitable for graphical representation. Although the focus is not on 'hard prefix prompts', the study does contribute to the field of prompt engineering by demonstrating alternative ways to optimize user interactions with LLMs."
visualizing linguistic diversity of text datasets synthesized by large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract presented describes a tool, LinguisticLens, which is not directly related to the study of 'hard prefix prompts' in prompt engineering. However, the tool's function of analyzing syntactic diversity of LLM-generated datasets can have tangential relevance to understanding how different prompting methods, including hard prefix prompts, might influence the generative outcomes of LLMs. Therefore, while the primary focus of the abstract is on visualization and analysis of textual diversity rather than on prompt engineering, the insights from such a tool could potentially inform prompt engineering studies to some extent, which warrants a moderate relevance rating."
feasibility of using the privacy-preserving large language model vicuna for labeling radiology reports.,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The provided abstract discusses the application of a large language model (LLM), Vicuna, for labeling radiography reports in a manner that preserves patient privacy. The relevance to prompt engineering lies in the mention of 'using a single-step or multistep prompting strategy' which indicates that prompts were designed and tested to achieve the desired outcome. The study evaluates the efficacy of these prompting strategies against established benchmarks. However, the study is not focused on prompt engineering itself, but rather on the application of prompts in a specific domain (medical report analysis). This means that while prompt engineering is a component of the study, the focus is not on the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts,' but on the feasibility and efficacy of running a privacy-preserving LLM locally for practical applications in healthcare. Therefore, the relevance is moderate, as insights into prompt engineering can be gleaned but are not the central focus of the study."
forward-backward reasoning in large language models for mathematical verification,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study presents an innovative approach in using large language models for mathematical verification through FOBAR, which involves prompt engineering to some extent by integrating backward reasoning into the prompts to verify answers.

The relevance is moderate since insights into explainability might overlap with some aspects of prompt engineering, such as understanding model behavior and improving performance through better prompts, without being the central focus."
adapting large language models via reading comprehension,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study explores a novel method of training large language models using domain-specific reading comprehension texts, which could indirectly relate to prompt engineering by enhancing the model's ability to understand and respond to prompts more effectively in different domains. However, the study does not directly address the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' which would be the focus of an engineering study on prompt format and structure. Thus, the relevance is moderate as the improvements in domain-specific prompting could benefit from such a training approach, but it is not centrally focused on prompt engineering itself."
react: synergizing reasoning and acting in language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper discusses an integrated approach where reasoning and acting are combined within LLMs, which is related to prompt engineering in the sense that it explores how to effectively prompt models to engage in both cognitive processes. Although it doesn't directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' it does deal with the broader topic of prompting LLMs to improve performance, suggesting some relevance. However, its focus on the 'ReAct' system's development and evaluation on specific tasks may not provide in-depth insights into the particular strategies used for engineering prompts, hence the rating isn't higher."
milan: masked image pretraining on language assisted representation,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract describes an approach to masked image pretraining using language-assisted representation, rather than directly involving 'hard prefix prompts' in the conventional sense associated with language models or text-based prompting. However, the mention of 'prompting decoder architecture' suggests an involvement of prompting mechanisms, which could be related to the topic of prompt engineering in a broader sense. Hence, it receives a moderate relevance rating due to the possible connection through the architecture design that involves prompts in the image-language pretraining context, but it does not directly focus on prompt engineering studies for text-based models or the specific concept of 'hard prefix prompts'."
are hard examples also harder to explain? a study with human and model-generated explanations,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study touches on aspects of prompting when it investigates size and hardness of the test samples and their impact on the quality of explanations generated by both humans and GPT-3. This is indirectly related to prompt engineering, as the quality of outputs generated by LLMs may depend on the prompt's difficulty level, which can inform prompt engineering strategies. However, the study's primary focus is on the explainability and the comparison of human and model-generated explanations, not specifically on engineering prompts to improve LLM performance."

While prompt engineering is not directly mentioned, the study's focus on 'zero shot or few shot prompting' used by models like ChatGPT suggests an indirect relation to the topic. Thus, the paper may contain insights relevant for understanding the broader context of prompt engineering, particularly in how PFMs accommodate prompt-based interactions. However, since prompt engineering is a more specific discipline focused on the design and optimization of prompts to effectively leverage models like GPT or BERT, and the summary does not explicitly address hard prefix prompts or prompt engineering techniques, it receives a moderate rating of relevance."
reading comprehension quiz generation using generative pre-trained transformers,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study is related to the application of AI in the educational domain, specifically using a pre-trained transformer model (GPT-3) for quiz generation which is a type of prompt engineering. However, it does not specifically focus on 'hard prefix prompts' but rather on the general capability of transformer models to generate educational content. The relevance to prompt engineering is present since quiz generation can be considered a form of prompt design, yet it is not focused on the systematic review of prompts or their optimization, which would make it highly relevant to prompt engineering studies."
codegen: an open large language model for code with multi-turn program synthesis,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract describes research on program synthesis using large language models, particularly focusing on a new model called CODEGEN. The relevance to prompt engineering is moderate because it touches on the use of prompts specifying subproblems in a multi-step paradigm for program synthesis. This suggests that different prompt structures (such as multi-turn prompts) can significantly affect the performance of code generation tasks, which is a part of the broader area of prompt engineering. However, the abstract does not specifically discuss 'hard prefix prompts' or provide a systematic review of prompt engineering, so it is only partially relevant to the specified topic of a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts."
in-context autoencoder for context compression in a large language model,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract describes a method for compressing long contexts into compact memory slots, which although not directly related to 'hard prefix prompts', it does pertain to the broader field of prompt engineering by allowing for more efficient handling of prompts in large language models. This efficiency can impact how prompts are created, managed, and used in large language models. The connection to prompt engineering lies in the fine-tuning on instruction data, which likely would involve crafting prompts to generate desirable responses. However, since the primary focus appears to be context compression rather than prompt engineering techniques or the study of 'hard prefix prompts' specifically, the rating is not higher."
decomposed soft prompt guided fusion enhancing for compositional zero-shot learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract presents a study on a method for compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) using a framework called Decomposed Fusion with Soft Prompt (DFSP). While it is related to engineering prompts in the context of vision-language models, which indeed falls under the broader category of prompt engineering, it isn't directly focused on hard prefix prompts as mentioned in the initial request. The paper's relevance is therefore not exact but tangentially related since it involves the construction of vector combinations of learnable soft prompts, which can be considered a part of prompt engineering. However, the method described diverges from the original topic of 'hard prefix prompts,' which typically implies a non-modifiable text input for models, as opposed to the learnable prompts discussed here."
prompt-guided zero-shot anomaly action recognition using pretrained deep skeleton features,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study is somewhat related to prompt engineering as it incorporates user prompt-guided zero-shot learning which hints at the use of prompts to guide the anomaly detection model.

zero-shot text classification via self-supervised tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract discusses a novel approach to zero-shot text classification using self-supervised learning, which includes an alternative prompting method where the model learns to predict the first sentence of a paragraph. This is relevant to prompt engineering as it touches on the use of prompts to improve language model performance without relying on large-scale annotated data. However, the focus is more on the self-supervised learning aspect and the specific learning objective, rather than a deep dive into prompt engineering or hard prefix prompts specifically. Therefore, the relevance is moderate."
harnessing the zero-shot power of instruction-tuned large language model in end-to-end speech recognition,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract deals with the utilization of an instruction-tuned large language model within the context of ASR, which relates to prompt engineering in the sense that precise instructions are used to guide the LLM. However, the focus is more on the application of LLMs for improving ASR rather than on the study or optimization of the prompts themselves (i.e., hard prefix prompts or prompt engineering techniques). The relevance is moderate because it showcases an implementation of prompt-instructed LLMs, but it does not directly address a systematic review or study on prompt engineering."
interaction-aware prompting for zero-shot spatio-temporal action detection,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study describes the use of prompting as a mechanism to obtain more appropriate text features for zero-shot spatio-temporal action detection, which falls under the broader scope of prompt engineering. However, the context is very specialized and focuses more on the application to a specific domain (video processing and action detection) rather than the study of hard prefix prompts in general. The relevance is moderate because it deals with an application of prompts in a machine learning system, but it does not directly address a 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts' as the original query specifies."
zero-textcap: zero-shot framework for text-based image captioning,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract discusses the Zero-TextCap model for text-based image captioning. It touches on prompt engineering indirectly by mentioning the generation of candidate sentences from the prompt 'Image of' and the refinement process for improving caption quality and diversity. However, the main focus is on image captioning and OCR technology, rather than prompt engineering. The relevance to prompt engineering study is moderate because it deals with a specific use of prompts within a different field of study, i.e., text-based image captioning. The study is more relevant to the fields of computer vision and natural language processing than to the study of prompt engineering in general."
are soft prompts good zero-shot learners for speech recognition?,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract discusses 'soft prompts' in the context of automatic speech recognition and zero-shot learning, which is related to the field of prompt engineering, as it involves the manipulation of prompts to enhance model performance. However, the prompt specifically asks about 'hard prefix prompts,' and this study focuses on 'soft prompts,' not 'hard' ones. Therefore, the study is relevant to the broader field of prompt engineering but not directly relevant to the specified subset of 'hard prefix prompts.' The relevance rating acknowledges the connection to prompt engineering while also recognizing the divergence from the specified topic of 'hard prefix prompts'."
blended-nerf: zero-shot object generation and blending in existing neural radiance fields,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The presented work, Blended-NeRF, involves some aspects of prompt engineering, such as the use of text prompts to guide the editing of 3D scenes. This suggests a connection to natural language processing and the translation of text instructions to visual modifications. However, the focus seems to be more on the application of 3D neural radiance fields and the integration of new objects in existing scenes rather than on the detailed study of prompt engineering itself. Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering as a primary study objective appears to be moderate."
language models as zero-shot trajectory generators,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the abstract discusses the usage of Large Language Models for trajectory generation in robotics, which would require careful crafting of prompts to interact with the model effectively, the focus on 'hard prefix prompts' in the context of a comprehensive systematic review is not directly addressed. Although the principles of prompt engineering could be applied to formulate the inputs for GPT-4 in this study, the abstract does not specifically mention or concentrate on 'hard prefix prompts', nor does it suggest a systematic review of such prompts. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as the concept of prompting is involved, but not specific to the requested area of study."
zeroprompt: streaming acoustic encoders are zero-shot masked lms,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The study presents a technique called ZeroPrompt that is applied to streaming acoustic encoders, which is tangentially relevant to 'prompt engineering' since it involves what can be described as a prompting strategy. However, the core of the study focuses on streaming ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models and improving their latency, which is not directly related to the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' in the traditional sense of prompt engineering for language models. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as it deals with prompts in a different context than what 'prompt engineering study' might typically imply, which is often associated with text-based language model prompting."
zero-shot text-driven physically interpretable face editing,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The paper discusses text-driven face editing and involves the use of text prompts to guide the image editing process. Its relevance to prompt engineering is in the use of the CLIP model which involves understanding and correlating text descriptions to visual content. However, the primary focus of the paper seems to be on face editing using a novel method rather than on the study or improvement of prompt engineering techniques themselves. Therefore, it has some relevance due to the application of text prompts, but it is not a direct study on prompt engineering."
multi-view vision-prompt fusion network: can 2d pre-trained model boost 3d point cloud data-scarce learning?,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract discusses the fusion of 2D pre-trained models with 3D point cloud data through a novel network (MvNet) for few-shot 3D classification, which includes aspects of prompt learning inspired by NLP. Although the application is primarily for 3D classification in computer vision and not for prompt engineering in a textual context, the inspiration from prompt learning and the mention of using prompts to describe prior knowledge for image models suggests some relevance to the topic of prompt engineering study. However, since the primary focus is not on textual or linguistic prompts but on prompts that bridge 3D and 2D model data, the relevance is moderate but not high."
b-pet: the pet model with parameter-efficient learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract provided discusses the B-pet model, which focuses on few-shot learning (FSL), parameter efficiency, and storage reductions for model training and deployment. This involves the concept of 'prompt learning' as a component of the PET model, indicating some relevance to prompt engineering. However, the main content is centered on fine-tuning efficiency and parameter freezing, not directly on the systematic study or development of prompting methods. Consequently, relevance is limited to the aspect of 'prompt learning' in the context of the broader FSL and model efficiency discussions."
grass: unified generation model for speech-to-semantic tasks,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The paper is relevant to prompt engineering to some extent as it involves generating target text conditioned on a task-related prompt for audio data. Although it does focus on utilizing prompts for refining the production of target text, which is an aspect of prompt engineering, it specifically addresses speech-to-semantic tasks rather than hard prefix prompts within a text-input domain. Therefore, while it has some relevance due to the usage of prompts in the model's training and task execution, it is not a direct study on hard prefix prompts, reducing its relevance to the specific area of prompt engineering under review."
ontotype: ontology-guided zero-shot fine-grained entity typing with weak supervision from pre-trained language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper discusses a method which leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) for fine-grained entity typing (FET) and specifically mentions how it ensembles multiple PLM prompting results, suggesting a novel use of prompts in model processing. While the main focus of the study is on FET and it introduces OntoType, a zero-shot ontology-guided FET method, the paper still has relevance to prompt engineering since it deals with generating and refining prompts for PLMs to improve typing resolution. The significance of prompt engineering is not the central theme of the paper, but prompts play a significant role in the described methodology, which aligns with how prompts can be engineered to work with ontological structures. Therefore, the paper is somewhat relevant to prompt engineering but not directly focused on it."
lt at semeval-2023 task 1: effective zero-shot visual word sense disambiguation approaches using external knowledge sources,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper abstract is partially relevant to prompt engineering study as it discusses different textual prompting strategies as they relate to multi-modal machine learning and zero-shot capabilities. However, the main focus seems to be on Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) using pre-trained visiolinguistic models and external knowledge sources, rather than a direct emphasis on hard prefix prompts or a comprehensive analysis of prompt engineering. The relevance rating of 6 reflects that prompt engineering is a supporting concept in the study rather than the primary focus."
odor descriptor understanding through prompting,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study addresses a niche aspect of prompt engineering by focusing on generating word embeddings specific to olfactory descriptors, which implies a form of prompt optimization for a specialized application. The relevance to prompt engineering is moderate because it deals with improving the interaction between an NLP model and domain-specific language, which is an important aspect of prompt engineering. However, the paper does not seem to offer a broad investigation into hard prefix prompts or their systematic review, but rather presents practical methods for a specific type of prompting to improve performance in a specialized benchmark."
winning solution for the cvpr2023 visual anomaly and novelty detection challenge: multimodal prompting for data-centric anomaly detection,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study discusses the use of multimodal prompts within the context of zero-shot anomaly segmentation, which is related to the field of prompt engineering due to the involvement of customized prompts for model adaptation. While the study may not directly address 'hard prefix prompts', the concept of utilizing expert knowledge and context to create prompts for foundation models exhibits a component of prompt-engineering techniques. This relevance is not direct, as prompt engineering typically involves text-based language prompts for natural language models as opposed to prompts for visual anomaly detection; hence, the rating is above the midpoint but not fully aligned with the focus on prompt engineering."
a fine-grained comparison of pragmatic language understanding in humans and language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study addresses a comparison of pragmatic language understanding in both humans and language models, which indirectly relates to prompt engineering since the effectiveness of prompts can be influenced by a model's ability to deal with pragmatics and non-literal meanings. However, the study does not focus specifically on prompt engineering or on the design, structure, or optimization of prompts ('hard prefix prompts'), therefore the relevance is not direct and merits a mid-range rating."
knowledge-in-context: towards knowledgeable semi-parametric language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the discussed paper presents a novel semi-parametric language model architecture that is closely related to enhancing the performance of language models, it does not directly address prompt engineering, especially with regards to 'hard prefix prompts.' The architecture indeed involves prompting in the broader sense, as it uses prompts to generate output answers, but the main focus of the study lies in knowledge integration and model efficiency, rather than on the design or study of prompts themselves. Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering is somewhat tangential and not the central theme of the paper."
speechx: neural codec language model as a versatile speech transformer,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"While the abstract does discuss the use of audio-text prompts for speech generation and how SpeechX leverage task-dependent prompting for various speech tasks, it does not specifically address hard prefix prompts in the context of prompt engineering within the text generation domain, which is generally implied by prompt engineering. There is relevance to prompts and task-dependent prompting, but not directly to the study of hard prefix prompts in a systematic review sense, hence the intermediate score."
an investigation of llms' inefficacy in understanding converse relations,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The abstract presents a study on how LLMs process and understand converse relations, which relates to their semantic understanding capabilities. While this does touch on the issue of understanding structured semantics and could have indirect implications for prompt engineering (e.g., designing prompts that account for the converse relations might improve LLMs' performance), the study is not directly focused on prompt engineering or the effectiveness of hard prefix prompts. Thus, the relevance is moderate as the findings might inform prompt engineering strategies indirectly, but it is not the central theme of the study."
zero-shot generalization in dialog state tracking through generative question answering,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract discusses the use of a generative question-answering framework with a conditional language model for improving dialog state tracking, which indirectly relates to prompt engineering in that it deals with the generation of language model queries (which can be considered as prompts) for unseen constraints and slots. The system is designed to interpret natural language queries, akin to how prompts are used to extract information from language models. However, the specific focus of the study is not on prompt engineering itself or on the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts', but rather on the application of a generative language model to dialog systems for zero-shot adaptation. Therefore, while the study is relevant to the general field of language model applications (and thus has some relevance to prompt engineering), it does not directly address the subject of prompt engineering in relation to hard prefix prompts."
transformers as algorithms: generalization and stability in in-context learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study examines in-context learning and generalization in transformer models, which is relevant to prompt engineering as it relates to how these models use input prompts to infer outputs. However, the focus on 'hard prefix prompts' is not specifically addressed, meaning the study might offer insights related to prompt engineering more broadly rather than hard prefix prompts in particular. Therefore, the relevance is moderate."
differentially private in-context learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study touches on the deployment of large language models (LLMs) and their adaptation to new tasks, which relates to prompt engineering in the broader sense of preparing LMs for specific applications. However, the focus is primarily on maintaining privacy via Differentially Private In-context Learning (DP-ICL), and not on the prompt engineering techniques such as 'hard prefix prompts'. Although prompt engineering may rely on data privacy principles when integrating private data, the abstract lacks a direct mention or analysis of 'hard prefix prompts', yielding a moderate relevance score."
reward modeling for mitigating toxicity in transformer-based language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the study focuses on mitigating toxicity in language models, which is related to improving AI behavior and output quality, it is tangential to the specific topic of 'prompt engineering', particularly 'hard prefix prompts'. Prompt engineering involves crafting inputs to guide AI models more effectively, whereas this study seems centered on a method (Reinforce-Detoxify) for reducing toxicity. Although related, it is not a direct study of prompt engineering techniques, thus the moderate rating reflects this indirect relevance."
context-based narrative generation transformer (ngen-transformer),gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a text generation model, the NGen-Transformer, which is relevant to natural language processing and prompt engineering to some extent. It emphasizes the context assimilation capabilities of the architecture, which aligns with the concept of prompt engineering as it involves providing context or prompts for generating text. Although the paper appears to focus more on the model's architecture for story generation rather than on the systematic study of hard prefix prompts, the use of prompts (in the form of user-defined context) and performance evaluation on a prompt-based dataset (WritingPrompts) makes it moderately relevant to prompt engineering studies."
fp-detr: detection transformer advanced,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The paper 'fp-detr: detection transformer advanced' mentions the use of a concept analogous to prompts in NLP, where query positional embeddings serve as 'visual prompts' to assist in object detection. While this indicates a potential crossover concept with prompt engineering, it's specific to the visual domain rather than the textual domain typically associated with prompt engineering in NLP studies. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as it offers insight into how the idea of prompts can be applied in different contexts, but it does not address hard prefix prompts or their systematic review in NLP applications specifically."
"tryage: real-time, intelligent routing of user prompts to large language models",gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the described paper, 'tryage: real-time, intelligent routing of user prompts to large language models,' indirectly relates to the field of prompt engineering by addressing optimal model selection based on input prompts, it does not explicitly focus on 'hard prefix prompts' or the systematic review of these prompts. Prompt engineering generally refers to the design of input prompts to achieve better performance or more relevant responses from language models. The paper's relevance to prompt engineering is in its ability to select the best-suited model for a given prompt, which could be a component of a larger prompt engineering strategy. However, the absence of specific focus on 'hard prefix prompts' or systematic review thereof limits the relevance score."
tempo: prompt-based generative pre-trained transformer for time series forecasting,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The relevance to prompt engineering study is moderate. The described TEMPO framework does incorporate 'selection-based prompts' which indicates some element of prompt engineering. However, the core focus is on time series forecasting using generative transformers rather than the systematic review or study of hard prefix prompts in general. Therefore, the relevance is partial as it pertains to adapting prompts for time series tasks specifically rather than prompt engineering as a broader field."
phenaki: variable length video generation from open domain textual description,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract describes a model, Phenaki, which deals with generating videos from textual descriptions using a novel representation and learning approach. This is relevant to prompt engineering to the extent that it involves creating prompts (textual descriptions) that are used to generate content (videos). However, the focus of the study appears to be more on video synthesis and representation learning rather than on the design or optimization of the textual prompts themselves ('hard prefix prompts'). Therefore, the relevance is moderate, indicating a tangential connection to prompt engineering, particularly in how text prompts are used to generate complex media like videos, rather than a direct study on the engineering of prompts."
can language models automate data wrangling?,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The content seems to address the utilization of language models for data wrangling tasks, and while it does imply a certain level of task design and user interaction with language models (which could be related to prompt engineering), the focus on data wrangling rather than prompt design specifically for eliciting desired outputs from a language model suggests that this isn't a comprehensive study on hard prefix prompts. There is potential crossover in terms of understanding how prompts work in the context of data wrangling, but it is not directly about prompt engineering."
textdiffuser: diffusion models as text painters,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the study introduces TextDiffuser, which involves generating images from text prompts and might have indirect applications in understanding and improving how models handle text prompts, the main focus is on image generation and enhancing text coherence within visual content. The mention of prompts relates more to the input for image generation rather than the study of prompt engineering itself. Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering study is moderate as the techniques developed could be tangentially useful, but it is not the central theme of the research."
vector representations of idioms in conversational systems,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The study is partially relevant to prompt engineering as it touches on how training on specific language constructs (in this case, idioms) improves the performance of conversational systems. While it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' or the systematic review of such prompts, understanding how idiomatic expressions are handled by NLP systems can inform prompt design strategies and might be leveraged in the creation of more sophisticated prompts. This relevance is more tangential than direct to the focus of prompt engineering, thus warranting a mid-range rating."
generalization properties of retrieval-based models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the abstract discusses retrieval-based models and their generalization properties, which are relevant to the broader field of machine learning and could potentially be applied to prompt engineering with respect to selecting the best prompts in a retrieval-based manner, it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' or prompt engineering specifically. Therefore, its relevance to a systematic review on hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering studies is tangential rather than central."
attention satisfies: a constraint-satisfaction lens on factual errors of language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract provides insights into the internal mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs) related to factual accuracy, which is peripherally relevant to prompt engineering. Prompt engineering often involves crafting prompts to elicit accurate and reliable responses from a model. The study's focus on the attention mechanism and factual accuracy can be indirectly useful in understanding how prompts might be structured to improve the likelihood of factually correct outputs. However, the study does not directly investigate hard prefix prompts or prompt engineering techniques, therefore the rating isn't higher."
gpt4mia: utilizing geneative pre-trained transformer (gpt-3) as a plug-and-play transductive model for medical image analysis,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The relevance of the paper to prompt engineering is tangential rather than direct. It discusses using GPT-3 as a tool for medical image analysis, which implies a level of prompt engineering in structuring the interaction between the language model and the image analysis tasks. The paper's focus on technical treatments for efficiency and effectiveness might involve innovative prompt design strategies, which is pertinent to prompt engineering. However, because the central theme is the application of GPT-3 to medical image analysis rather than prompt engineering itself, the relevance is moderate."
pretraining data mixtures enable narrow model selection capabilities in transformer models,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The study relates indirectly to prompt engineering, as it deals with the ability of transformer models to perform in-context learning and adapt to new tasks based on their pretraining data mixture. Prompt engineering typically involves designing prompts to elicit desired behaviors or responses from LLMs. The relevance lies in understanding how different pretraining data affects the model's response to prompts, which is crucial for prompt engineers. However, the study does not explicitly focus on 'hard prefix prompts' which would be more directly aligned with prompt engineering, thus the rating reflects a moderate relevance."
plato-ad: a unified advertisement text generation framework with multi-task prompt learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract discusses PLATO-Ad, a framework for online advertisement text generation that incorporates multi-task prompt learning, which is related to prompt engineering. However, it does not focus specifically on 'hard prefix prompts' or systematic reviews of them, but rather the application of prompt learning to advertisement text generation. The relevance to prompt engineering exists due to the implementation of prompts in the learning process, but because the focus is on a specific application and not on a broad study or review of prompts, the rating is not higher."
rgb-t tracking via multi-modal mutual prompt learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study uses the concept of 'prompt learning' in the context of computer vision, specifically for RGB-T tracking, which demonstrates an application of prompt engineering to improve the interaction between different data modalities (visible and thermal images) and enhance the model's performance. The relevance to prompt engineering is evident in the design of the 'lightweight prompter' and the use of attention mechanisms as a form of information transfer, which can be seen as a specialized application of prompts in machine learning. However, the study does not directly focus on hard prefix prompts or their systematic review, which limits its relevance to the specific area of prompt engineering referred to in the original query. It is more related to the application and implementation of prompts in a practical task rather than the study of prompt engineering itself."
prefixmol: target- and chemistry-aware molecule design via prefix embedding,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The provided title and abstract refer to a generative model using 'prefix embeddings,' which can be seen as a form of prompt engineering, albeit in a different domain (molecular design rather than text generation). The concept of prefix embeddings as contextual prompts shares a conceptual similarity with prefix prompts in text-based models, as they both aim to guide the generation process under specific conditions. However, the application is quite niche and specific to chemistry and drug design, which means the focus is not on prompt engineering in the general sense but is instead applied in a specialized context. Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering studies is moderate but not direct, as it uses similar concepts in a domain-specific application."
towards a unified view on visual parameter-efficient transfer learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the study presents a framework in parameter efficient transfer learning (PETL) and investigates prefix-tuning, it does so in the context of vision models rather than language models, which is the primary domain for prompt engineering. However, the concept of a 'hard prefix prompt' isn't directly addressed, but the methods and findings could be considered somewhat relevant for those interested in the extension of prompt engineering concepts to the vision domain. Thus, relevance is moderate but not directly aligned with the specific focus of hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering studies."
evaluating adaptive pedagogical agents' prompting strategies effect on students' emotions,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The relevance to prompt engineering is moderate, as the study examines the impact of different prompting strategies on students' emotions within an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). While not directly focused on 'hard prefix prompts' or prompt engineering in the AI language model sense, the research does explore how different types of prompts can influence user experience and engagement, which can be parallel to how prompts are engineered to guide AI behavior. However, the specific connection to 'hard prefix prompts' in prompt engineering is not made, which limits the direct relevance to the topic."
impact of different pedagogical agents' adaptive self-regulated prompting strategies on learning with metatutor,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The study focuses on the effect of prompting strategies on learning outcomes within an educational tool, which marginally relates to prompt engineering as it deals with the design and effectiveness of prompts. Prompt engineering specifically pertains to the construction and optimization of prompts to improve the performance of artificial intelligence systems. While the study on pedagogical agents' prompting strategies is adjacent to this domain, its direct application to prompt engineering in AI is not clear. Therefore, the relevance is moderate."
smart homes for people with alzheimer's disease: adapting prompting strategies to the patient's cognitive profile,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study's relevance to prompt engineering is moderate. While it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' in the context of machine learning or computational prompt engineering, it deals with the adaptation of prompts (cognitive assistance) to users' needs, which parallels the customization aspect of prompt engineering. Furthermore, the development of guidelines for effective prompting strategies and an experimental protocol has some commonalities with the principles of designing and testing prompts in AI systems. However, the application is specific to smart homes and Alzheimer's patients and may not fully translate to the broader field of prompt engineering study."
understanding the effect of in-video prompting on learners and instructors,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"While the abstract discusses in-video prompting, which is a form of engagement tactic within an educational context, it does not specifically mention or focus on 'hard prefix prompts' or the systematic review of prompt engineering. The study is relevant to the broader context of prompt design and use in learning environments but does not directly address the topic of a comprehensive review of hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering. Therefore, it has some relevance due to its focus on the effects of prompts in an instructional setting but falls short of directly addressing the specified topic of hard prefix prompts."
effects of a progressive prompting-based educational game on second graders' mathematics learning performance and behavioral patterns,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study focuses on the use of prompting strategies within a game-based learning environment, which is tangentially related to the broader concept of 'prompt engineering' in that it involves the design of prompts to guide users (learners) towards specific outcomes. However, 'prompt engineering' typically refers to designing prompts to interact with AI systems or computer models, rather than human students. Therefore, while the educational prompting strategy is a form of prompt design and may share underlying principles with prompt engineering for AI, it is not a direct study on 'hard prefix prompts' as the context differs. The relevance is moderate because the skills and insights from designing effective prompts for education might be applicable to prompt engineering for AI in developing user instructions or interactions."
considering student choice when selecting instructional strategies: a comparison of three prompting systems.,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study touches upon the effectiveness of prompting systems in educational settings, which is tangentially relevant to prompt engineering as it involves the use of prompts to enhance learning outcomes. However, prompt engineering typically focuses on improving the interaction with AI models and systems, rather than instructional strategies for human learning. Despite the different context, principles from studying human response to prompts could be insightful for designing AI prompts, thus earning a moderate relevance rating."
can chatgpt understand too? a comparative study on chatgpt and fine-tuned bert,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract addresses the understanding ability of ChatGPT as compared to fine-tuned BERT models and mentions the use of advanced prompting strategies to improve ChatGPT's understanding. While the main focus is on the comparative analysis of model performance, the mention of prompting strategies implies some relevance to prompt engineering. However, the abstract does not offer a detailed exploration or direct focus on hard prefix prompts or their systematic review, which reduces its direct relevance to the specified topic of prompt engineering study."
boosting static resource leak detection via llm-based resource-oriented intention inference,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The provided abstract outlines research on 'InferROI,' a system designed to detect resource leaks in code using large language models (LLMs) for intention inference. Though this approach employs prompts to guide the LLM toward inferring intentions from code snippets, it is indirectly relevant to prompt engineering. The use of prompts is in the context of static analysis in software engineering, while prompt engineering generally refers to designing prompts to accurately elicit specific responses from language models. Since this research involves instructing an LLM via prompts, it could offer some insights into prompt design and effectiveness; hence, it is given a moderate relevance rating. However, it does not focus on prompt engineering as a primary study area, which is why the rating is not higher."
fake news in sheep's clothing: robust fake news detection against llm-empowered style attacks,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The relevance to prompt engineering study in the context of 'hard prefix prompts' is moderately substantial as the abstract describes the use of 'style-oriented reframing prompts' which are a form of prompts used in engaging with Language Models (LLMs). Although the main focus is on fake news detection and style-agnostic approaches to improve robustness against camouflage attempts by LLMs, the application of prompts is directly related to the mechanics of how LLMs are manipulated or interacted with to produce or detect certain styles of content. Therefore, while the primary topic is not a comprehensive systematic review of hard prefix prompts, the paper relates to one aspect of prompt engineering—using prompts to reframe content style to train a more robust detection model."
cgsmp: controllable generative summarization via multimodal prompt,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The abstract discusses the use of a multimodal approach to reduce hallucination in Natural Language Generation (NLG) and improve the quality of abstractive summarization, relating to language model performance and prompt design to some extent. However, the focus here is on the use of multimodal (image and text) inputs rather than on the study of 'hard prefix prompts' specifically. While prompt engineering is a broader field that includes various methods to control language model outputs, this paper seems to address only a subset of that field related to multimodal interaction and controllability. Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering study is moderate, as it could provide insights into one aspect of the field without directly focusing on hard prefix prompts."
revisiting the plastic surgery hypothesis via large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The abstract describes how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be utilized for Automated Program Repair (APR) and discusses the relevance of the plastic surgery hypothesis in this context. The mention of 'prompting strategy' indicates some level of relevance to prompt engineering, as it suggests that the study explores how to effectively use prompts to improve model performance. However, the focus seems to be on the application of LLM-based APR rather than on the study of prompt engineering itself. Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering is moderate, as the paper likely touches on elements of prompt engineering as part of APR, but is not centered on prompt engineering as its primary topic of investigation."
instructprotein: aligning human and protein language via knowledge instruction,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract describes InstructProtein, a large language model trained for bidirectional human and protein language comprehension, which involves specialized prompt engineering to facilitate this unique form of language alignment. Prompt engineering is relevant here, as it is necessary to construct instructions that enable the model to translate between human language and protein sequences. The knowledge graph-based instruction framework mentioned can be seen as an advanced form of prompt engineering, designed to overcome issues of annotation imbalance and instruction deficits. However, the content is more focused on the application within a bioinformatics context rather than prompt engineering as a standalone subject. Therefore, while prompt engineering is a component of the research, the paper is not primarily about prompt engineering in the broader sense but rather a specific application of it."
evaluation of gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 for supporting real-world information needs in healthcare delivery,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The abstract highlights the need for further research in prompt engineering to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare settings. It mentions the variability in the quality of responses by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to specific information needs, which implies that there is room for improvement in how prompts are designed to achieve better results. This is relevant to the study of prompt engineering since it suggests that better-designed prompts could potentially lead to more accurate and useful responses from LLMs. However, the abstract does not directly focus on 'hard prefix prompts' but rather on the broader application of LLMs in healthcare. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant but not fully focused on prompt engineering, hence the rating of 6."
chatspot: bootstrapping multimodal llms via precise referring instruction tuning,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study primarily focuses on improving human-AI interactivity within multimodal large language models by introducing a more sophisticated method of instruction via referring prompts. While this does involve some form of prompt engineering, specifically in relation to how the model receives and understands instructions, it is not strictly concerned with 'hard prefix prompts' as it seems to combine multiple input modalities (language, clicks, drag-and-drop, drawings). The relevance is thus moderate because it does intersect with the concept of prompt design and efficacy but does not explicitly address the engineering of hard-coded text prompts within a linguistic context."
chill: zero-shot custom interpretable feature extraction from clinical notes with large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The described study focuses on using expert-crafted queries to generate interpretable features from health records, which indirectly relates to prompt engineering since it involves crafting queries (prompts) for a model to generate useful outputs. However, the study applies the technique for feature extraction from clinical notes rather than the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts,' which is more specific to improving prompt engineering methods or understanding their efficacy. Therefore, the relevance is moderate but not directly focused on the prompt engineering field as defined by the initial prompt."
interleaving pre-trained language models and large language models for zero-shot nl2sql generation,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The abstract discusses the development of a framework (ZeroNL2SQL) that involves using prompts to guide language models for a specialized task (NL2SQL generation). Although the specific term 'hard prefix prompts' is not used, the concept of using prompts to direct language model behavior is central to the study. This indicates some relevance to the study of prompt engineering but not directly focused on hard prefix prompts or a systematic review of them. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to prompt engineering but not fully aligned with a comprehensive systematic review on that specific topic."
divknowqa: assessing the reasoning ability of llms via open-domain question answering over knowledge base and text,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The study focuses on the retrieval capabilities of Large Language Models and how they can be grounded on heterogeneous knowledge sources for better question-answering performances. While it relates to prompt engineering in the broader context of machine learning and enhancing LLMs' interactions with external data, the study's primary concern is not with hard prefix prompts directly but rather with improving the information retrieval process, which is a component of the system that supports effective prompting. Therefore, its relevance to prompt engineering, specifically to a systematic review of hard prefix prompts, is tangential rather than central."
scpatcher: mining crowd security discussions to enrich secure coding practices,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The paper discusses SCPatcher, a tool that uses Prompt Learning with a Large Language Model to improve secure coding practices by mining crowd security discussions. Although the primary focus is on enhancing secure coding, the use of Prompt Learning is relevant to the study of prompt engineering.

Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering is secondary and not central to the main objective of the paper, resulting in a moderate rating of relevance."
can large language models be good path planners? a benchmark and investigation on spatial-temporal reasoning,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The title and abstract indicate research dealing with how large language models can handle tasks requiring spatial-temporal reasoning, which includes the analysis of few-shot prompting methodologies. These methodologies are a subset of prompt engineering, as they explore how to design prompts that enable language models to perform spatial reasoning tasks. While the focus is not explicitly on 'hard prefix prompts' as the prompt engineering study may suggest, few-shot prompting, as part of prompt engineering, is relevant because it discusses the effectiveness of different prompting techniques. Therefore, the study is indirectly related to the broader field of prompt engineering but does not directly address the comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts."
amortizing intractable inference in large language models,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The provided abstract discusses the use of amortized Bayesian inference to sample from intractable posterior distributions in autoregressive large language models (LLMs) and touches on chain-of-thought reasoning as a latent variable modeling problem. While this research is related to the functioning and fine-tuning of LLMs, it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' or any aspect of prompt engineering. However, the methods developed in this work for fine-tuning LLMs could indirectly benefit prompt engineering by enabling more efficient adaptation of models to specific tasks, which is why the relevance rating is not at the lowest end of the scale."
fabricator: an open source toolkit for generating labeled training data with teacher llms,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The relevance to prompt engineering is moderate. The abstract discusses the use of LLMs (Large Language Models) to generate labeled data for training other NLP models, which does involve prompting the LLM to produce specific outputs. The process of designing these prompts to effectively direct the LLM's output towards useful labeled data creation is related to 'prompt engineering.' However, the abstract does not specifically mention 'hard prefix prompts' nor does it focus on a comprehensive systematic review of such. Therefore, while the topic is related to prompt engineering, it does not fully align with a 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts.' Thus, the given rating is moderately relevant, but not directly on point."

beyond bounding box: multimodal knowledge learning for object detection,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The paper deals with the use of language prompts for improving object detection in machine learning, indicating relevance to prompt engineering in that it involves designing prompts to facilitate learning. However, the study's primary focus is on multimodal knowledge learning in object detection, rather than on prompt engineering specifically. It discusses the creation and use of prompts as part of the method but does not center around designing or systematically reviewing hard prefix prompts, which would be more directly related to prompt engineering studies."
meta learning to bridge vision and language models for multimodal few-shot learning,gpt-4-1106-preview,4,"The presented abstract discusses a multimodal meta-learning approach to bridge vision and language models, aiming to improve few-shot learning by automatically adapting to new tasks. The relevance to 'prompt engineering' is tangential since the abstract mentions induction of tasks without hand-engineering and could relate to auto-generating or tuning prompts in a broad sense. However, it deals more with meta-learning and the interplay between different modalities than the specific study of hard prefix prompts as described in the initial request. Therefore, it is only moderately related to prompt engineering as the focus of the paper is on model adaptation and few-shot learning rather than prompt design or engineering."
a prompt-based multimodal tabular transformer encoder for medical intervention duration estimation,gpt-4-1106-preview,6,"The study introduces a prompt-based approach within a medical context, focusing on a multimodal deep learning framework for medical intervention duration estimation. While it does not directly address 'prompt engineering' in the broader sense, the use of prompts in conjunction with a pre-trained sentence encoder indicates an application of prompt engineering principles. Hence, the relevance is moderate, as it shows an example of how prompts can be interfaced with other machine learning components, but the study is specific to medical interventions and does not cover prompt engineering as a standalone subject."
mpt: multimodal prompt tuning for event detection,gpt-4-1106-preview,5,"The presented abstract discusses a multimodal Prompt Tuning approach for event detection that incorporates both images and text, which pertains to prompt engineering in the context of modal feature aggregation and the use of soft prompts.
