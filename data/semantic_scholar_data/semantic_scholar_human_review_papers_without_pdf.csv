why do pretrained language models help in downstream tasks? an analysis of head and prompt tuning,6,"The paper's abstract describes an analysis of head tuning and prompt tuning, which are highly relevant to the study of prompt engineering as a concept. Prompt tuning particularly involves the process of adjusting prompts to achieve better performance in downstream tasks, which is a subset of prompt engineering. However, the abstract suggests a specific focus on the theoretical underpinnings of why pretrained language models are effective, using generative models like HMMs for analysis. The relevance to prompt engineering is therefore significant but not completely aligned, as it does not explicitly address the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' or the practical aspect of designing prompts, which might be expected from a 'comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts'."
surreal vr pong: llm approach to game design,4,"The title and abstract provided discuss the application of generative models and computational creativity in the context of 3D game design and propose the integration of prompt-based creation into the gameplay itself. While it does not specifically focus on 'hard prefix prompts,' it does touch on prompt engineering by suggesting that prompts can be an element within game mechanics. This indicates some relevance to the study of prompt engineering, but it is not a direct or comprehensive examination of hard prefix prompts in systematic reviews or other studies."
zero-shot prompting for code complexity prediction using github copilot,6,"The relevance of this study to prompt engineering is somewhat indirect. The study investigates the capacity of GitHub Copilot, which leverages a Large Language Model, to predict code complexity in a zero-shot manner. While this addresses the model's ability to understand and generate responses in a specific technical domain without prior training, it does not directly explore the engineering or optimization of prompts (i.e., hard prefix prompts). However, the study does touch on a key aspect of prompt-based interactions with AI, which is the model's performance on tasks with no fine-tuning. This suggests relevance in terms of understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLMs like GPT3 when prompted with untrained tasks, which is a component of prompt engineering."
investigating causal understanding in llms,6,"The study discussed in the abstract is only partially relevant to prompt engineering since the investigation focuses on the causal understanding capabilities of LLMs rather than specifically on 'hard prefix prompts.' However, the research touches on how varying prompt presentations can affect LLM responses, which is related to the concept of prompt engineering. The relevance lies in understanding the influence of presentation form, both in hard prefix prompts and other types of prompting. The rating is not higher because the study does not directly focus on 'hard prefix prompts,' which seems to be the specific area of interest."
quantifying memorization across neural language models,4,"While the abstract discusses the issue of memorization in language models, which is indirectly related to how models respond to prompts, it does not directly address prompt engineering, particularly the study of 'hard prefix prompts.' The information provided is relevant to the construction and reliability of prompts in the context of avoiding the elicitation of memorized data, but it does not specifically focus on engineering prompts for systematic review that the original query suggests. Therefore, the relevance is moderate but not directly applicable to the study of hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering."
what initiates evidence‐based reasoning?: situations that prompt students to support their design ideas and decisions,6,"The document is somewhat relevant to the study of prompt engineering as it discusses the situations that lead students to use evidence-based reasoning, which is an important factor in understanding how to structure prompts to elicit informed responses. Although it focuses on evidence-based reasoning in the context of engineering education rather than the specific area of 'hard prefix prompts', understanding the broader principles of how prompts can initiate certain types of thinking is pertinent to prompt engineering."
a prompt-aware neural network approach to content-based scoring of non-native spontaneous speech,4,"The study focuses on using neural network techniques to assess non-native spontaneous speech, which includes using prompts as a condition for the model. Although this involves engineering a model to interact with prompts, the core emphasis is on automatic assessment rather than on the systematic review or deep exploration of 'hard prefix prompts', which would be central to prompt engineering studies. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as it only touches on prompt-related aspects within a broader application context."
how do different reflection prompts affect engineering students’ academic performance and engagement?,6,"The abstract describes a study that relates to prompt engineering in the educational sense and not in the AI field. It addresses the effectiveness of different types of reflection prompts (generic versus specific) on students' performance and engagement in an engineering course context. While it is not directly about the engineering of AI-based prompt systems, the insights regarding how specificity in prompts can influence outcomes may be partially relevant to the nuances involved in designing prompts for AI systems. However, the primary focus of the study on academic performance and engagement of engineering students limits the relevance to prompt engineering in AI. Thus, the rating reflects moderate relevance due to indirect connections that could be drawn between educational prompting strategies and AI prompt design considerations."
v2p: vision-to-prompt based multi-modal product summary generation,6,"The paper presents a multi-modal product summary generation framework that uses a Generative Pre-trained Language Model with prompts derived from visual attributes, which aligns with the concept of prompt engineering in the sense that it involves designing prompts for guiding text generation. However, the focus seems to be more on the multi-modal interaction and summary generation, rather than on the systematic study of hard prefixes or prompt structures themselves. Therefore, while it is relevant due to its use of prompts, it may not directly address the nuances of prompt engineering as pertains to hard prefix prompts specifically, hence the rating of 6."
prompt deep light-weight vessel segmentation network (plvs-net),6,"The relevance to prompt engineering in this study is moderate. The use of 'prompt blocks' within the network architecture indicates an innovation related to how the network processes information, which might be relevant to prompt engineering in the broader sense of designing inputs that improve the performance of a neural network. However, the primary focus appears to be on biomedical image segmentation, rather than the development or study of prompting methods for natural language processing or other general AI applications. Thus, while the term 'prompt' is used, it may not directly align with the typical context of prompt engineering, which is often related to improving AI responses or behavior based on textual input."
the utility of an evidence-based lecture and clinical prompt as methods to improve quality of care in colorectal cancer screening,4,"The study appears to investigate the effectiveness of clinical prompts in a medical setting, which tangentially relates to the concept of prompt engineering. While not directly studying 'hard prefix prompts' or prompt engineering for AI or computational systems, the principle of using prompts to improve performance outcomes has some relevance to the broader field of study. However, the specific application to colorectal cancer screening and the focus on evidence-based lectures differentiates this from the typical context of prompt engineering in technology, which usually refers to the designing of inputs to elicit desired responses from AI models or systems."
information and communication technology based prompting for treatment compliance for people with serious mental illness.,5,"The provided abstract discusses the use of ICT-based prompting to improve treatment compliance in people with serious mental illness, which aligns with the broader concept of 'prompts' in behavior modification. However, the term 'hard prefix prompts' typically refers to a specific approach in natural language processing or AI-related prompt engineering, which is not the focus of this study. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as it deals with prompts in a different context than what 'prompt engineering study' typically would imply in technological or AI research."
visual prompt tuning for few-shot text classification,6,"The paper abstract introduces a novel method of Visual Prompt Tuning for few-shot text classification that utilizes vision-language pre-training models, which is somewhat relevant to prompt engineering as it involves a form of prompt tuning. However, the primary focus is on incorporating visual elements rather than exclusively on texts or verbal prompts, which traditionally constitute 'prompt engineering' in language models. The relevance rating is given a moderate score because it deals with tuning aspects pertinent to the deployment of large-scale language models, although it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' as described in the original study topic."
augprompt: knowledgeable augmented-trigger prompt for few-shot event classification,5,"The title suggests that the study is related to prompt engineering as it mentions 'augmented-trigger prompt' which implies a method of prompt design for enhanced performance in an NLP task (few-shot event classification). However, without an abstract or TLDR, it is challenging to assess the depth of relevance to prompt engineering, hence a middle-of-the-road rating is given. More information would be required for a more accurate rating."
prompt-based self-training framework for few-shot named entity recognition,5,"The title suggests the study involves 'prompt-based' methodology, which is relevant to prompt engineering. However, without more information from the abstract or TLDR, it's challenging to determine the extent of relevance to hard prefix prompts specifically. The study focuses on few-shot named entity recognition, which may involve prompts, but it is unclear how systematically the prompts are reviewed or engineered in the study. A neutral score reflects this partial relevance based on the information provided."
balanced distributed augmentation for multi-label few shot learning with prototypical network,4,"The abstract indicates that the study involves novel pipeline for automating the prompt generation, which is somewhat relevant to prompt engineering, particularly if the automated generation includes what could be considered 'hard prefix prompts.' However, the main focus of the paper appears to be on data augmentation techniques and sentiment analysis for few-shot learning rather than directly on prompt engineering. The relevance is therefore moderate and not the primary emphasis of the research."
retrieving visual facts for few-shot visual question answering,6,"The abstract describes a research study where a language model is prompted with facts retrieved from an image, to improve the performance of few-shot visual question answering systems. While it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' as in the study of prompts in the context of natural language processing, it does involve the process of selecting specific information (facts from an image) to inform the prompting process for a language model. Thus, it demonstrates relevance to prompt engineering by showing how tailored information can be used to elicit better responses from a model. However, because it focuses primarily on image-based data and facts rather than text-based prompting, it is not fully centered on 'prompt engineering' as typically understood within NLP, hence the mid-range rating."
"machine translation with large language models: prompting, few-shot learning, and fine-tuning with qlora",4,"The abstract discusses machine translation using large language models and evaluates different methodologies including zero-shot prompting, which is closely related to prompt engineering. However, the focus on QLoRA fine-tuning indicates a greater emphasis on the fine-tuning process rather than on prompt engineering itself. The relevance is present but not central to the topic of prompt engineering, therefore a moderate rating reflects the connection without overstating its focus."
application of cognitive rehabilitation theory to the development of smart prompting technologies,4,"While the study addresses the use of prompting technologies, which is a form of human-computer interaction, it primarily focuses on cognitive rehabilitation and assistive technologies for older adults with cognitive impairments. The relevance to 'prompt engineering' in the context of hard prefix prompts and systematic review is tangential. The study could be peripherally related to prompt engineering in the way it seeks to optimize the design of prompts for a specific application (assistive technology), but it does not directly study or review the more general field of prompt engineering, especially as it might relate to conversational AI, machine learning or data input systems."

The study could be peripherally related to prompt engineering in the way it seeks to optimize the design of prompts for a specific application (assistive technology), but it does not directly study or review the more general field of prompt engineering, especially as it might relate to conversational AI, machine learning or data input systems."
application of cognitive rehabilitation theory to the development of smart prompting technologies,4,"The document appears to discuss the application of cognitive rehabilitation theory to the development of smart prompting technologies for assisting older adults with cognitive impairments. While it does touch upon the design and effectiveness of prompts (which is indirectly related to prompt engineering), the focus is more on the application of CRT in the development of assistive technologies rather than on a comprehensive systematic review of hard prefix prompts or on the specifics of engineering prompt systems. Thus, the relevance to prompt engineering study, particularly in the context of a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts, is moderately low, warranting a rating of 4."

Thus, the relevance to prompt engineering study, particularly in the context of a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts, is moderately low, warranting a rating of 4."
embracing ai for better quality engineering,5,"The provided text briefly mentions 'prompt engineering for testing use cases', indicating that prompt engineering is indeed part of the study in the context of quality engineering with AI. However, the focus seems to be on a broader application of AI in quality engineering and does not provide specific details on hard prefix prompts or a comprehensive systematic review on such prompts in engineering study. Therefore, the relevance is moderate, as it touches on the subject but does not delve deeply into it."
telehealth intensive care unit nurse surveillance of sepsis,6,"The article is somewhat relevant to prompt engineering study, as it involves the development of a 'sepsis prompt' that integrates usability and human factors engineering standards. Although the focus is on the medical application of prompts, rather than on the hard prefix prompts often used in machine learning or computational contexts, the principles of design, usability testing, and alert optimization could provide insights into prompt engineering methodologies. The evaluation of sensory processing, cognitive processing, and user satisfaction has parallels in the design of effective prompts in other fields. However, the specific application to a telehealth ICU scenario and sepsis surveillance limits the direct applicability to general prompt engineering studies."
"artificial intelligence in engineering and society: blue skies, black holes, and the job of requirements engineers (keynote)",6,"The abstract provides a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence's impact on engineering and society, touching briefly on the use of large language models to address requirements engineering problems which may involve prompt engineering to some extent. However, the focus on prompt engineering, particularly in the context of 'hard prefix prompts,' is not explicit or central to the abstract. It mentions the potential for using prompts to check requirements completeness and to generate models, suggesting some relevance to the field of prompt engineering. The relevance rating is above average because prompt engineering is definitely a subset of the topics covered, but since the abstract does not focus on the systematic review of hard prefix prompts specifically, it does not score higher."
feasibility of using the privacy-preserving large language model vicuna for labeling radiology reports.,6,"The provided abstract discusses the application of a large language model (LLM), Vicuna, for labeling radiography reports in a manner that preserves patient privacy. The relevance to prompt engineering lies in the mention of 'using a single-step or multistep prompting strategy' which indicates that prompts were designed and tested to achieve the desired outcome. The study evaluates the efficacy of these prompting strategies against established benchmarks. However, the study is not focused on prompt engineering itself, but rather on the application of prompts in a specific domain (medical report analysis). This means that while prompt engineering is a component of the study, the focus is not on the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts,' but on the feasibility and efficacy of running a privacy-preserving LLM locally for practical applications in healthcare. Therefore, the relevance is moderate, as insights into prompt engineering can be gleaned but are not the central focus of the study."
forward-backward reasoning in large language models for mathematical verification,6,"The study presents an innovative approach in using large language models for mathematical verification through FOBAR, which involves prompt engineering to some extent by integrating backward reasoning into the prompts to verify answers. While it doesn't directly address 'hard prefix prompts' in prompt engineering, the use of CoT prompting and the integration of answer verification templates are related to the techniques used in prompt engineering to improve AI performance. It shows the importance of prompt design in eliciting correct outputs from models. The relevance score isn't higher because it doesn't specifically discuss or review hard prefix prompts, which is the focus of the prompt engineering study mentioned."
react: synergizing reasoning and acting in language models,6,"The paper discusses an integrated approach where reasoning and acting are combined within LLMs, which is related to prompt engineering in the sense that it explores how to effectively prompt models to engage in both cognitive processes. Although it doesn't directly address 'hard prefix prompts,' it does deal with the broader topic of prompting LLMs to improve performance, suggesting some relevance. However, its focus on the 'ReAct' system's development and evaluation on specific tasks may not provide in-depth insights into the particular strategies used for engineering prompts, hence the rating isn't higher."
reading comprehension quiz generation using generative pre-trained transformers,4,"The study is related to the application of AI in the educational domain, specifically using a pre-trained transformer model (GPT-3) for quiz generation which is a type of prompt engineering. However, it does not specifically focus on 'hard prefix prompts' but rather on the general capability of transformer models to generate educational content. The relevance to prompt engineering is present since quiz generation can be considered a form of prompt design, yet it is not focused on the systematic review of prompts or their optimization, which would make it highly relevant to prompt engineering studies."
codegen: an open large language model for code with multi-turn program synthesis,6,"The abstract describes research on program synthesis using large language models, particularly focusing on a new model called CODEGEN. The relevance to prompt engineering is moderate because it touches on the use of prompts specifying subproblems in a multi-step paradigm for program synthesis. This suggests that different prompt structures (such as multi-turn prompts) can significantly affect the performance of code generation tasks, which is a part of the broader area of prompt engineering. However, the abstract does not specifically discuss 'hard prefix prompts' or provide a systematic review of prompt engineering, so it is only partially relevant to the specified topic of a comprehensive systematic review on hard prefix prompts."
a topic-based prompt learning method for zero-shot stance detection,4,"While the study involves the use of prompts to determine the stance detection ability, it is focused more on the classification and processing of language with respect to stance detection, rather than the creation or systematic review of hard prefix prompts in the context of prompt engineering. Since prompt engineering typically refers to methods for improving language model responses, and this paper seems to touch on related concepts without being squarely focused on prompt engineering, it receives a moderate rating."
vision-language models are zero-shot reward models for reinforcement learning,6,"The abstract describes the use of vision-language models (VLMs) as zero-shot reward models in reinforcement learning, which includes a component of prompt engineering by providing text prompts to specify tasks. Although the main focus is on reinforcement learning and the efficacy of VLMs in this context, the mention of using 'minimal prompt engineering' indicates that there is a relevance to the study of crafting prompts. However, the primary emphasis is not on the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' or the intricacies of prompt engineering methods, which would be required for a higher relevance score."
language models as zero-shot trajectory generators,4,"While the abstract discusses the usage of Large Language Models for trajectory generation in robotics, which would require careful crafting of prompts to interact with the model effectively, the focus on 'hard prefix prompts' in the context of a comprehensive systematic review is not directly addressed. Although the principles of prompt engineering could be applied to formulate the inputs for GPT-4 in this study, the abstract does not specifically mention or concentrate on 'hard prefix prompts', nor does it suggest a systematic review of such prompts. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as the concept of prompting is involved, but not specific to the requested area of study."
zeroprompt: streaming acoustic encoders are zero-shot masked lms,5,"The study presents a technique called ZeroPrompt that is applied to streaming acoustic encoders, which is tangentially relevant to 'prompt engineering' since it involves what can be described as a prompting strategy. However, the core of the study focuses on streaming ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models and improving their latency, which is not directly related to the systematic review of 'hard prefix prompts' in the traditional sense of prompt engineering for language models. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as it deals with prompts in a different context than what 'prompt engineering study' might typically imply, which is often associated with text-based language model prompting."
b-pet: the pet model with parameter-efficient learning,4,"The abstract provided discusses the B-pet model, which focuses on few-shot learning (FSL), parameter efficiency, and storage reductions for model training and deployment. This involves the concept of 'prompt learning' as a component of the PET model, indicating some relevance to prompt engineering. However, the main content is centered on fine-tuning efficiency and parameter freezing, not directly on the systematic study or development of prompting methods. Consequently, relevance is limited to the aspect of 'prompt learning' in the context of the broader FSL and model efficiency discussions."
transformers as algorithms: generalization and stability in in-context learning,6,"The study examines in-context learning and generalization in transformer models, which is relevant to prompt engineering as it relates to how these models use input prompts to infer outputs. However, the focus on 'hard prefix prompts' is not specifically addressed, meaning the study might offer insights related to prompt engineering more broadly rather than hard prefix prompts in particular. Therefore, the relevance is moderate."
context-based narrative generation transformer (ngen-transformer),6,"The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a text generation model, the NGen-Transformer, which is relevant to natural language processing and prompt engineering to some extent. It emphasizes the context assimilation capabilities of the architecture, which aligns with the concept of prompt engineering as it involves providing context or prompts for generating text. Although the paper appears to focus more on the model's architecture for story generation rather than on the systematic study of hard prefix prompts, the use of prompts (in the form of user-defined context) and performance evaluation on a prompt-based dataset (WritingPrompts) makes it moderately relevant to prompt engineering studies."
fp-detr: detection transformer advanced,5,"The paper 'fp-detr: detection transformer advanced' mentions the use of a concept analogous to prompts in NLP, where query positional embeddings serve as 'visual prompts' to assist in object detection. While this indicates a potential crossover concept with prompt engineering, it's specific to the visual domain rather than the textual domain typically associated with prompt engineering in NLP studies. Therefore, the relevance is moderate as it offers insight into how the idea of prompts can be applied in different contexts, but it does not address hard prefix prompts or their systematic review in NLP applications specifically."
pretraining data mixtures enable narrow model selection capabilities in transformer models,5,"The study relates indirectly to prompt engineering, as it deals with the ability of transformer models to perform in-context learning and adapt to new tasks based on their pretraining data mixture. Prompt engineering typically involves designing prompts to elicit desired behaviors or responses from LLMs. The relevance lies in understanding how different pretraining data affects the model's response to prompts, which is crucial for prompt engineers. However, the study does not explicitly focus on 'hard prefix prompts' which would be more directly aligned with prompt engineering, thus the rating reflects a moderate relevance."
smart homes for people with alzheimer's disease: adapting prompting strategies to the patient's cognitive profile,6,"The study's relevance to prompt engineering is moderate. While it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' in the context of machine learning or computational prompt engineering, it deals with the adaptation of prompts (cognitive assistance) to users' needs, which parallels the customization aspect of prompt engineering. Furthermore, the development of guidelines for effective prompting strategies and an experimental protocol has some commonalities with the principles of designing and testing prompts in AI systems. However, the application is specific to smart homes and Alzheimer's patients and may not fully translate to the broader field of prompt engineering study."
understanding the effect of in-video prompting on learners and instructors,4,"While the abstract discusses in-video prompting, which is a form of engagement tactic within an educational context, it does not specifically mention or focus on 'hard prefix prompts' or the systematic review of prompt engineering. The study is relevant to the broader context of prompt design and use in learning environments but does not directly address the topic of a comprehensive review of hard prefix prompts in prompt engineering. Therefore, it has some relevance due to its focus on the effects of prompts in an instructional setting but falls short of directly addressing the specified topic of hard prefix prompts."
effects of a progressive prompting-based educational game on second graders' mathematics learning performance and behavioral patterns,6,"The study focuses on the use of prompting strategies within a game-based learning environment, which is tangentially related to the broader concept of 'prompt engineering' in that it involves the design of prompts to guide users (learners) towards specific outcomes. However, 'prompt engineering' typically refers to designing prompts to interact with AI systems or computer models, rather than human students. Therefore, while the educational prompting strategy is a form of prompt design and may share underlying principles with prompt engineering for AI, it is not a direct study on 'hard prefix prompts' as the context differs. The relevance is moderate because the skills and insights from designing effective prompts for education might be applicable to prompt engineering for AI in developing user instructions or interactions."
considering student choice when selecting instructional strategies: a comparison of three prompting systems.,6,"The study touches upon the effectiveness of prompting systems in educational settings, which is tangentially relevant to prompt engineering as it involves the use of prompts to enhance learning outcomes. However, prompt engineering typically focuses on improving the interaction with AI models and systems, rather than instructional strategies for human learning. Despite the different context, principles from studying human response to prompts could be insightful for designing AI prompts, thus earning a moderate relevance rating."
boosting static resource leak detection via llm-based resource-oriented intention inference,6,"The provided abstract outlines research on 'InferROI,' a system designed to detect resource leaks in code using large language models (LLMs) for intention inference. Though this approach employs prompts to guide the LLM toward inferring intentions from code snippets, it is indirectly relevant to prompt engineering. The use of prompts is in the context of static analysis in software engineering, while prompt engineering generally refers to designing prompts to accurately elicit specific responses from language models. Since this research involves instructing an LLM via prompts, it could offer some insights into prompt design and effectiveness; hence, it is given a moderate relevance rating. However, it does not focus on prompt engineering as a primary study area, which is why the rating is not higher."
fake news in sheep's clothing: robust fake news detection against llm-empowered style attacks,6,"The relevance to prompt engineering study in the context of 'hard prefix prompts' is moderately substantial as the abstract describes the use of 'style-oriented reframing prompts' which are a form of prompts used in engaging with Language Models (LLMs). Although the main focus is on fake news detection and style-agnostic approaches to improve robustness against camouflage attempts by LLMs, the application of prompts is directly related to the mechanics of how LLMs are manipulated or interacted with to produce or detect certain styles of content. Therefore, while the primary topic is not a comprehensive systematic review of hard prefix prompts, the paper relates to one aspect of prompt engineering—using prompts to reframe content style to train a more robust detection model."
cgsmp: controllable generative summarization via multimodal prompt,5,"The abstract discusses the use of a multimodal approach to reduce hallucination in Natural Language Generation (NLG) and improve the quality of abstractive summarization, relating to language model performance and prompt design to some extent. However, the focus here is on the use of multimodal (image and text) inputs rather than on the study of 'hard prefix prompts' specifically. While prompt engineering is a broader field that includes various methods to control language model outputs, this paper seems to address only a subset of that field related to multimodal interaction and controllability. Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering study is moderate, as it could provide insights into one aspect of the field without directly focusing on hard prefix prompts."
divknowqa: assessing the reasoning ability of llms via open-domain question answering over knowledge base and text,4,"The study focuses on the retrieval capabilities of Large Language Models and how they can be grounded on heterogeneous knowledge sources for better question-answering performances. While it relates to prompt engineering in the broader context of machine learning and enhancing LLMs' interactions with external data, the study's primary concern is not with hard prefix prompts directly but rather with improving the information retrieval process, which is a component of the system that supports effective prompting. Therefore, its relevance to prompt engineering, specifically to a systematic review of hard prefix prompts, is tangential rather than central."
scpatcher: mining crowd security discussions to enrich secure coding practices,6,"The paper discusses SCPatcher, a tool that uses Prompt Learning with a Large Language Model to improve secure coding practices by mining crowd security discussions. Although the primary focus is on enhancing secure coding, the use of Prompt Learning is relevant to the study of prompt engineering. However, the paper does not specifically focus on 'hard prefix prompts' as implied by the term 'prompt engineering study.' Therefore, the relevance to prompt engineering is secondary and not central to the main objective of the paper, resulting in a moderate rating of relevance."
amortizing intractable inference in large language models,4,"The provided abstract discusses the use of amortized Bayesian inference to sample from intractable posterior distributions in autoregressive large language models (LLMs) and touches on chain-of-thought reasoning as a latent variable modeling problem. While this research is related to the functioning and fine-tuning of LLMs, it does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' or any aspect of prompt engineering. However, the methods developed in this work for fine-tuning LLMs could indirectly benefit prompt engineering by enabling more efficient adaptation of models to specific tasks, which is why the relevance rating is not at the lowest end of the scale."
the impact of scaffolding prompts on the collaborative problem solving of ill-structured tasks by undergraduate engineering student groups,5,"The study seems to focus on scaffolding prompts in the context of collaborative problem solving for ill-structured tasks, rather than hard prefix prompts specifically. Nonetheless, the research is relevant to the field of prompt engineering to some extent because it explores how certain types of prompts can affect the problem-solving abilities of engineering students. This could indirectly inform studies or practices within prompt engineering, especially concerning the design of prompts that facilitate learning and problem-solving in educational settings."
exploring the impacts of cognitive and metacognitive prompting on students’ scientific inquiry practices within an e-learning environment,4,"While the study focuses on the use of prompts to enhance scientific inquiry in an educational context, and thus tangentially touches upon the concept of prompting, it does not directly address prompt engineering related to natural language processing or AI prompt design. The relevance lies in the investigation of prompts effectiveness, which could be conceptually extended to prompt engineering for AI systems. However, the study's primary focus on educational cognitive and metacognitive prompts limits its direct applicability to prompt engineering study, specifically regarding hard prefix prompts."
which prompts make the difference? data prioritization for efficient human llm evaluation,5,"The provided title and abstract describe a study focused on the optimization of human evaluations of large language models through data prioritization, which is indirectly relevant to prompt engineering. Prompt engineering typically involves constructing prompts to elicit specific outputs from language models but does not directly address the question of human evaluators in the loop. However, the study's implications for improving the efficiency of model-evaluation can influence the prompt engineering process indirectly by refining the human feedback loop connected to prompt tuning performances. This makes it somewhat relevant to prompt engineering, especially in the scope of human-in-the-loop evaluations and performance measurement. Nonetheless, the study does not seem to address 'hard prefix prompts' or any specific prompt engineering methodologies, which limits its direct relevance to the field of prompt engineering."
multimodal multi-task stealth assessment for reflection-enriched game-based learning,4,"The study mentioned does not directly address 'hard prefix prompts' or 'prompt engineering' as it appears to be more focused on game-based learning environments and using a stealth assessment framework for educational purposes. The relevance comes from the use of in-game reflection prompts and the multifaceted assessment of student responses which tangentially touches upon the concept of prompts and reflection in learning. However, it does not engage with the specific study of engineering prompts in the context of AI systems or conversational models, which would be necessary for a higher relevance rating."
making a case for spatial prompting in human-robot communication,4,"This paper is somewhat relevant to prompt engineering in that it discusses communication strategies with robots, which could include developing prompts for human-robot interaction. However, it focuses on 'spatial prompting' and non-verbal communication cues, which is a different area than 'hard prefix prompts,' which are typically textual or verbal in nature and used in language model interactions. The study's relevance to prompt engineering is tangential and not directly aligned with the concept of hard prefix prompts in language models or more conventional prompting techniques."
the smartweb corpora: multimodal access to the web in natural environments,4,"The description indicates that the chapter discusses a prompting scheme called SitPro, a recording technique, and properties of created corpora. While the mention of a prompting scheme suggests relevance to prompt engineering, there is no explicit mention of 'hard prefix prompts' or a systematic review approach. The relevance appears to be tangential rather than directly focused on prompt engineering as it pertains to pre-determined structured prompts. The rating reflects moderate relevance due to the connections to prompts and data acquisition which could be applicable to prompt engineering studies but lacks specificity regarding 'hard prefix prompts'."
a prompt-based multimodal tabular transformer encoder for medical intervention duration estimation,6,"The study introduces a prompt-based approach within a medical context, focusing on a multimodal deep learning framework for medical intervention duration estimation. While it does not directly address 'prompt engineering' in the broader sense, the use of prompts in conjunction with a pre-trained sentence encoder indicates an application of prompt engineering principles. Hence, the relevance is moderate, as it shows an example of how prompts can be interfaced with other machine learning components, but the study is specific to medical interventions and does not cover prompt engineering as a standalone subject."
mpt: multimodal prompt tuning for event detection,5,"The presented abstract discusses a multimodal Prompt Tuning approach for event detection that incorporates both images and text, which pertains to prompt engineering in the context of modal feature aggregation and the use of soft prompts. However, the primary focus is on event detection using multimodal inputs rather than on hard prefix prompts specifically. The mention of 'prompt tuning' indicates relevance to prompt engineering, but the absence of discussion about hard prefix prompts specifically results in a moderate relevance rating."
prompt cache: modular attention reuse for low-latency inference,5,"The abstract discusses Prompt Cache which is related to the optimization of language model inference using attention state reuse in prompts; however, it does not directly address a 'hard prefix prompt' which might suggest a fixed prompt structure or content in the systematic review. The approach outlined in the abstract is relevant to prompt engineering, as it deals with efficient prompt handling in LLMs, but it doesn't focus on prompt content or structure, thereby making it moderately relevant."
