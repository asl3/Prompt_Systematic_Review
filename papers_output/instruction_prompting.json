        "abstract": "Text-based person search (TBPS) aims to retrieve the images of the target person from a large image gallery based on a given natural language description. Existing methods are dominated by training models with parallel image-text pairs, which are very costly to collect. In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore TBPS without parallel image-text data (\u03bc-TBPS), in which only non-parallel images and texts, or even image-only data, can be adopted. Towards this end, we propose a two-stage framework, generation-then-retrieval (GTR), to first generate the corresponding pseudo text for each image and then perform the retrieval in a supervised manner. In the generation stage, we propose a fine-grained image captioning strategy to obtain an enriched description of the person image, which firstly utilizes a set of instruction prompts to activate the off-the-shelf pretrained vision-language model to capture and generate fine-grained person attributes, and then converts the extracted attributes into a textual description via the finetuned large language model or the hand-crafted template. In the retrieval stage, considering the noise interference of the generated texts for training model, we develop a confidence score-based training scheme by enabling more reliable texts to contribute more during the training. Experimental results on multiple TBPS benchmarks (i.e., CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid) show that the proposed GTR can achieve a promising performance without relying on parallel image-text data.",

Two experimental groups with 12 and 15 kindergarten children respectively learned two sets of 17 words counterbalanced to be taught first explicitly or first implicitly. Their learning gain was compared with that of 21 no-treatment control group children. Both explicit and implicit instruction prompted broader vocabulary knowledge; explicit instruction also prompted more in-depth vocabulary knowledge. These effects sustained over time. Individual variation showed that in implicit instruction, children with low short-term memory seemed to gain more breadth of vocabulary in the short run, but also to forget more in the long run. In explicit instruction, verbal short-term memory and vocabulary tended to facilitate the breadth of vocabulary in the long run.",

        "abstract": "This thesis investigated the development, consistency and facilitators of children\u2019s innovation in the physical, tool-use domain. Despite gaining increasing interest in developmental psychology, understanding of the ontogeny of innovation remains in its infancy. Following the formulation of an operational definition of innovation and associated criteria in Chapter 2, the innovatory ability of 4- to 9-year-old children was examined using the Multiple-Methods Box (MMB): a novel puzzle box from which a reward can be extracted using different tools, access points and exits. Findings reported in Chapter 3 demonstrated that few children innovated in the aftermath of social demonstrations of tool use (akin to innovation by modification); rather, they largely relied on the observed task solution. However, instances and rates of children\u2019s innovation were seen to increase in response to inefficacious social information (Chapter 3) and when provided with additional time and explicit instructions/prompts to explore the MMB (Chapter 6). Individual differences in children\u2019s innovative or imitative behaviour appeared largely independent of their performance on a battery of tasks assessing constructs related to innovation, as explored in Chapter 4. However, this study revealed some behavioural consistency in puzzle-box contexts, suggestive of consistent individual differences in children\u2019s propensity, or preference, to engage in asocial/individual learning. Finally, in the intervention study of Chapter 5, individual achievement goals appeared of greater salience than cues to conventionality of innovative behaviour, which did not differentially enhance 8- to 9-year-olds\u2019 innovation when presented with the MMB task in the absence of social demonstrations. Together, the thesis findings highlight the value of the dual study of imitation and innovation, in discovering adaptive trade-offs between the two, and the need to consider innovation in its various forms, owing to likely disparities in developmental trajectories, cognitive requirements, and primary difficulties. The educational applications and cultural implications are discussed.",

The plaintiff was a bricklayer employed by builders, the first defendants, who had contracted with a regional hospital board, the second defendants, to instal a lift in their hospital. The third defendants were a firm of architects employed by the hospital board to prepare plans for the construction of the lift. The building contract between the builders and the hospital board provided that the work was to be carried out in accordance with the architects' directions. One of the architects inspected the premises and gave instructions on the site direct to the plaintiff to cut a chase or groove in the side of a stone gable without shoring or strutting the gable. He knew that the plaintiff would carry out his instructions promptly on that day. Salmon J. had no doubt at all that an ordinary architect using reasonable care and skill would certainly have realised the extreme danger of cutting a chase without shoring or strutting the gable, and that knowledge of this danger was not to be expected of the plaintiff, a bricklayer. While the plaintiff was cutting out a small piece of stone, after the chase had been cut, the gable fell inwards injuring him.

        "abstract": "Knowledge base with multiple hops quizzing aims to discover the subject entity in a question at a distance from the knowledge base\u2019s answer entity for multiple hops. The lack of supervised signals for the intermediate phases of multi-hop inference, which leaves a model only able to get input on the final output, is a significant difficulty for the study, where the inference instructions for the intermediate steps cannot be effectively optimized and the forward propagation of inference states is weakened. Most of the existing research approaches use global attention to motivate the model to learn the inference instructions of each hop, which has been shown to fail to achieve effective performance in weakly supervised tasks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an intermediate inference attention mechanism to handle multi-hop knowledge base quizzing tasks. Inspired by the human execution of multi-hop quizzing where each hop question is influenced by the previous hop answer, in this approach, the model pays more attention to the inference state generated by the previous hop inference instruction when generating each hop inference instruction, prompting a close interaction between the inference state of the intermediate step and the inference instruction, and providing effective attentional feedback for the optimization of the intermediate step inference instruction. On the KBQA dataset in the integrated energy service domain, which is self-constructed in this research, we conduct comprehensive comparison experiments. The findings suggest that the technique we provided achieves optimum performance in this study.",

        "abstract": "This report is a descriptive study of the role that on-line courses might have on the development of Professional Learning Communities (PLC\u2019s) that support national leadership initiatives of participating high school biology teachers. The one hundred teachers involved in the Life Sciences for a Global Community (LSGC) Institute are expected not only to deepen their content knowledge, but also impact their district and state biology curricula. Additionally, the dispersion of Institute participants across the country presents a unique opportunity to develop, communicate, and implement a national coherent reform agenda. However, the geographic distance presents a barrier to collaborative design of leadership projects. Therefore, the LSGC Institute designed web-based, distance learning courses as a means for both the instruction and development of distant professional relationships. This study is an initial investigation into the impact that three web-based courses had on the development of a national Professional Learning Community. We first report on themes and patterns that were derived from a conceptual analysis of the discourse generated in the first cohort of teachers during three on-line courses offered during the academic years 2007-2008. We then discuss the themes and patterns generated by this initial analysis as to the likelihood that they indicate movement toward a Professional Learning Community. Most of the comments across courses were characterized by individuals responding to instructional prompts. The second and third most common responses were interactions among the students, some related to teaching biology while others covered matters of school context. The emergent themes in the conceptual analysis were found to strongly align with three dimensions of Professional Learning Communities (PLC\u2019s) and weakly align with two dimensions. The results of this analysis will inform the Year Two on-line courses to include more structures to support the dimension of emerging leadership among the teachers. 86 P.BALCERZAK, V. MAY, and B. SCHAAL Life Sciences for a Global Community: Description of Institute Washington University in St. Louis, a leader in life sciences education and research, has developed the Life Sciences for a Global Community (LSGC) Institute, a high school biology teacher institute program leading to a master\u2019s degree in biology. The Institute offers an innovative approach to high school biology teaching and learning, centered around an interdisciplinary curriculum taught by world class researchers. Institute faculty are recognized leaders in all areas of biological research. They include sixteen faculty members, eight of whom are full professors. The program design includes two Summer Institutes at Washington University, work during the academic year with on-line support, and a leadership component. A mixed method research design will generate data regarding effectiveness, provide accountability, and inform dissemination. Through the Institute, there is a commitment to preparing teachers to improve their students\u2019 biological content knowledge, and to help sustain change in teaching practice at their schools and districts. Project leaders envision a rigorous interdisciplinary approach, combining content knowledge and the broad implications for human impact. To this end, the project has the following goals: \u2022 Develop a national cadre of master teachers of high school biology who demonstrate intellectual engagement with and mastery of global issues in life science, and who use related research-based pedagogy and challenging content in their courses; \u2022 Improve interest, engagement, and achievement by affected students in secondary biology; and, \u2022 Promote Institute partners\u2019 and participants\u2019 development as local and national educational leaders through participation in a national Professional Learning Community. To assess teacher and student knowledge acquisition and achievement, the evaluation is built on a random-assignment control design of three cohorts of teachers who each begin the program in sequential years: 2007, 2008, and 2009. Of the teachers who applied and were accepted to the project, one hundred were assigned randomly to initial treatment and control groups. Teachers and students of Cohorts II and III serve as control groups for the programming presented to Cohort I. On-line administration of content pre-/post-tests and surveys of students\u2019 attitude toward learning biology were administered in Spring 2008. Results are currently being collected and analyzed. DEVELOPING LEADERSHIP IN A NATIONAL COHORT OF SECONDARY BIOLOGY TEACHERS... 87 Leadership Development: A National Professional Learning Community Transfer of the content and enthusiasm for the discipline into the teachers\u2019 classrooms and the development of a national Professional Learning Community is another major component of the Institute program. However, the geographical dispersion of teachers within each of the three cohorts presented a unique challenge to the development of a leadership program that is based on collaborative models. Literature describing the dimensions of local Professional Learning Communities guided the design of the national model [1, 2]. The vehicle used to develop and maintain communication between teachers across the nation is a series of on-line courses during the academic year. This study used the following courses: 1) Chemistry for Biology Teachers; 2) Case Studies in Biology; and, 3) Program Capstone I. It provides an initial look at the effectiveness of this tool in building and sustaining professional relationships that are likely to lead to collaborative leadership. Methods of Analysis The following is an analysis of the use of an on-line course structure as an instrument supporting the development of the national Professional Learning Community (PLC). We analyzed the written discourse of the teachers during the on-line courses by conducting a conceptual analysis [3]. The unit of transcript analysis for this study was the message level, which allowed multiple coders to agree on the total number of messages [4]. We then ranked the themes and patterns generated by this analysis according to those supported by the most evidence to those supported by the least. Evidence in this case was considered to be the quantity and quality of the statements made by each of the participants in the on-line system during each of the courses. The themes and patterns emerging from the analysis of the transcripts were then coded and discussed according to the alignment of each with the dimensions of a published framework characterizing Professional Learning Communities [1]. Results of Analysis Each course had between 500 and 700 entries on the on-line discussion board over a fifteen-week period of time. The conceptual analysis identified five major themes and patterns evident across courses (see Table 1). For the purposes of this study, a theme/pattern is discussed if more than five participants indicated evidence, multiple times, within each course. The predominant theme, occurring on average in 48.3% of the messages, was derived from the 88 P.BALCERZAK, V. MAY, and B. SCHAAL discussion among individuals sharing thoughts that were within the parameters of the course assignment. Two types of messages characterized these participant comments, one relating to instructors and the other to anyone in the cybercommunity.

However, some plants perform CAM photosynthesis where CO2 is banked or stored for later use. In these plants, stomata open at night and remain closed during the day. The CO2 is converted to an acid and stored during the night. During the day, the acid is broken down and the CO2 is released to RUBISCO (an initial enzyme) for photosynthesis. The CAM plants include many succulents, such as cacti and agaves, and also some orchids and bromeliads. DEVELOPING LEADERSHIP IN A NATIONAL COHORT OF SECONDARY BIOLOGY TEACHERS... 89 The comment above shows an example of individual student-to-instructor interaction, as well as illustrating the depth of content that can be discussed in a distance learning environment. The following comments (posted on 9-22-07) show how several individuals respond to course design prompts in sequence without interacting with each other: \u2022 The first post\u2014\u201cAnimation on chemical bonding was excellent.

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper describes three studies addressing the effects of enthusiasm (E) versus non-enthusiasm (NE) on the acquisition of skills taught to young children with autism.. Study 1 compared the effects of E vs. NE for teaching similar skills with slightly different topographies. Study 2 compared the effects of E vs. NE while teaching exactly the same skill; and study 3 examined the social validity of E vs. NE. Results of the first two studies were variable. E had no effect on skill acquisition in three cases; more effect than NE in two cases; and less effect than NE in one case. Study 3 indicated that parents and professionals discriminated the difference between the two conditions and preferred E over NE. Keywords: autism, enthusiasm, skill acquisition, social validity. Introduction Several instructional methods have been shown to be effective when teaching skills to children diagnosed with autism, including incidental teaching (Hart & Risley, 1968), discrete trial teaching (Lovass, 1987), milieu teaching (Kaiser, 1993), and naturalistic teaching strategies (Charlop-Christy & LeBlanc, 1999). Although differences exist among these instructional methods, several procedures are used consistently across each. For example, each method typically includes clear instructions, prompting, a system for prompt fading (e.g., prompt delay), and reinforcement of correct responses. In addition to these commonly used procedures to teach new skills, a recommendation is often made for teachers to be enthusiastic during instruction. In fact, being enthusiastic while teaching has been described as an important component in a number of models proposed for teaching children with autism. For example, in their discussion of the Developmental Social-Pragmatic model Prizant, Wetherby, and Rydell (2000) stated that \"emotional expression and affect sharing are central to the interactive and learning process\" (p. 205). Similarly, in their description of peer-implemented pivotal response training, Schreibman, Stahmer, and Pierce (1996) highlighted the importance of positive affect used by peers during the training. They recommended that peers should \"act in a highly animated fashion both verbally and nonverbally to increase social competence\" (p. 365). Furthermore, enthusiasm has been described as a good instructional method when providing praise (Anderson, Taras, & O'Malley Cannon, 1996, p. 187) and as \"crucial in fostering language acquisition\" (Rappaport, 1996, p. 307). Despite these claims about the importance of enthusiasm when teaching young children with autism, few studies have addressed this issue and most have included only typically developing children or adults. For example, Burts, McKinney and Burts (1985) investigated the effects of three levels of teacher enthusiasm (low, medium, and high) to teach concepts to young typical children. No differences were found between the three levels of enthusiasm on learning the concepts. Teachers reported, however, that students were more attentive, interested, and responsive in the high enthusiasm condition. In another study, Filcheck, McNeil, and Herschell (2001) examined the effects of enthusiastic praise, non-enthusiastic praise, and non-enthusiastic description on compliance and general behavior of 30 children between the ages of 3 and 5 years. The results from this study showed that the children had significantly higher rates of compliance in the non-enthusiastic description condition than in the enthusiastic praise condition. The children, however, had higher rates of general behavior (i.e., marble dropping game) in the enthusiastic praise condition than in the non-enthusiastic description condition. In another study, Lamers and Hall (2003) examined the effects of voice prosody (i.e., enthusiastic, conversational, monotonous) during instruction for children with autism and typical children. In study 1, only 3 of 12 children with autism showed a preference for a particular prosody (preference varied across children). \u2026",

        "abstract": "The Center for Technology in Education (CTE), a partnership between Johns Hopkins University and the Maryland state department of education, developed a model for teaching autistic students that integrates technology-based instructional and behavioral supports into existing curriculum. The goal is to promote student gains in communication, social skills, and academics, ab well as to increase students' overall involvement in classroom activities. The model recommends teacher training in providing clear instructions, prompts and prompt fading, positive reinforcement, behavior modification techniques, and advanced teaching principles such as targeting student responsiveness and providing students with opportunities for appropriately communicating their needs. The model also advocates the use of light or high technology based on student needs and demands of the learning task. Light and high technology include equipment such as voice output communication devices, picture systems, sequence and cue cards, touch screens, modified keyboards, switch access devices, and sign language. Teachers also need to target behaviors related to motivation, cooperation, and responsiveness; learning strategies and methods that help students learn more efficiently; and skills that help all students function in the inclusive educational setting. Equally important is the development of an individualized continuity plan that promotes longitudinal gains and transitions across teams of staff members within a school or across schools, and the use of school-wide staff training to promote methods of inclusion. Currently, CTE is exploring alternative methods for disseminating technical assistance and teacher training to local education agencies throughout Maryland using distance learning classrooms, in-class teleconferencing, and listserv technology.

Burke, Ph.D. Center for Technology in Education Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, Maryland PREPARING SCHOOL SYSTEMS TO DELIVER A HYBRID EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS WITH AUTISM VIA DISTANCE LEARNING CLASSROOMS, IN-CLASS TELECONFERENCING, AND LISTSERV TECHNOLOGY One of the most difficult challenges teachers and local educational agencies face today is educating students with pervasive developmental disorders such as autism. Teachers frequently describe these children as unique, puzzling, mysterious, and difficult to teach. They often comment that their students with autism rarely interact, communicate, or appear motivated to participate in academic or social activities. A committed teacher provided the following comment before receiving training: \"He came into my room the first day and cried and showed absolutely no interest in anything; I was at a loss.\" Given the widespread behavioral deficits characteristic of autism and the limited resources available, teachers repeatedly face an enormous task as they strive to help these children learn. Aside from posing a challenge to teachers, LEAs are recurrently in a quandary as they form policy and develop curricula. Unfortunately, LEAs typically commit their resources to a single approach, then quickly discover that one approach does not easily serve all of their students with autism. The Center for Technology in Education (CTE), a partnership of Johns Hopkins University and the Maryland State Department of Education, is developing a hybrid paradigm in w11:.ch technology-based instructional and behavioral supports are infused into existing curricular activities to help promote gains in communication, social skills, and academics, as well as to increase the children's overall involvement in classroom activities. In addition, CTE is exploring alternative methods tbr disseminating technical assistance to LEAs throughout the state of Maryland using Distance Learning Classrooms, In-Class Teleconferencing, and LISTSERV Technology. Technology-Based Hybrid Educational Model for Childrot With Autism This hybrid paradigm is based on interdisciplinary research and years of educational experience and has four central components: Effective Behavioral Teaching Principles Curriculum-Wide Integration of Technology Flexible and Longitudinal Curriculum Guide Systemic Change Activities 112 BEST OR PAILMILE Effective Behavioral Teaching Principles A set of fundamental teaching principles, based on 30 years of research, now exists and forms the basis for many more advanced teaching strategies. The use of these principles is a central part of the approach. While many professionals are familiar with these principles, it is advantageous to delineate them clearly and to stress their importance in working with students with pervasive developmental disorders such as autism. All educational staff members should be trained in the use of these principles. It is equally vital that significant others, such as parents, learn to use these principles in less structured settings. A brief overview of these fundamental teaching principles is presented below. I. Effective instructions/requests. For all children, but especially for students with autism, instructions should be brief and clear, should be phrased in the form of a request, should be presented when you have the child's attention or should be used to get the child to attend to you, and should be individualized for each child. 2. Prompts and prompt fading. Prompts can help the child to respond and learn new skills. They can be used to help guide the child to respond. In using prompts, it is important to use the least intrusive, yet effective, prompt. Prompts can be verbal, gestural, and physical. When physical prompts are used, it is advantageous not to overuse \"hand-over-hand\" or other full physical \"holding\" prompts. While eftective, these are very difficult to fade. 3. Consequences. Consequences, in the form of positive reinforcement, should involve presenting highly preferred items or other events contingent on the display of the appropriate target behavior. It is vital that the items be things that the child clearly wants and finds reinforcing. In general, consequences should come soon after the child exhibits the target behavior. In addition, delivering positive consequences following a sequence of both disruptive and cooperative behaviors might inadvertently produce an increase in the disruptive behaviors. If a child first shows disruptive behaviors, then displays appropriate behaviors and is subsequently reinforced, he may learn that he needs to exhibit both to get reinforcement. It is usually advisable not to reinforce these chains of behaviors. In recent years, increased emphasis has been placed on integrating natural/direct reinforcers throughout a child's dav. Natural/direct reinforcers are consequences that are directly related to the activity. For instance, if a child uses a picture exchange system to communicate that the child wants a break, giving the child a break would be a natural reinforcer. Placing emphasis on using natural/direct reinforcers, rather than relying only on artificial reinforcers often leads to increased performance and cooperation. 4. Chainiag, Chaining involves breaking down a complex task into steps, establishing criteria for success for each step, and teaching the child to perform each step satisfactorily before adding the next step. S. Shaping. Shaping involves reinforcing closer approximations of the target response. For instance, if an essentially nonverbal child says \"C\" for Cup, the teacher would reinforce the child. If the child subsequently says \"Cu\" he would be reinforced. If he then said \"C\". no reinforcement would be provided. Only better approximations are reinforced. In addition to the fundamental teaching procedures described above, during the course of a training project, training would be extended to cover more advanced principles of effective teaching. Depending on the needs of the educational staff, these advanced procedures could include the following: 1. Use of the principle of partial participation. The principle of partial participation involves the idea of setting the occasion for the student to partially participate in an activity or task and arranging for the student to succeed. Over time, the student will learn more and more and will eventually learn to perform the entire task in a more independent manner. Using this principle throughout a child's day helps to ensure low levels of disruptive behavior. In a consistent manner, it is otlen beneficial to reinforce approximations and attempts. This concept centers on the view that a child who is truly trying to correctly respond should be provided with positive feedback relative to the response. This principle could be used during academic and leisure time periods. 2. Targeting cooperation and responsiveness. Cooperation forms the basis of effective teaching interactions between teachers and students. Cooperation is often increased as students are taught new academic and social skills. It is oflen advantageous, however, to directly target cooperation and responsiveness in a systematic, yet natural, manner throughout a child's day across settings and activities, and with people. Many children are more focused, responsive, and cooperative when relatively greater emphasis is placed on: Presenting the child a relatively short and simple request or instruction. Ensuring that the child is oriented to the adult when the instruction is presented. Using an appropriate prompting st",

        "abstract": "This study investigated whether it was more beneficial to provide the learners in computer-based learning environments access to on-demand (self-regulated) help after they committed an error in problem solving or for the learning environment to externally regulate the presentation of instructional help. Furthermore, two different presentational formats\u2014textual and pictorial\u2014of instructional prompts were examined. This study was conducted with a computer-based learning environment that introduced high school students without any prior content-specific knowledge to the principles of parallel and series electrical circuit analysis. We found that textual prompts facilitated problem solving statistically significantly better than pictorial prompts. Moreover, the learners provided with externally regulated prompts reported statistically significantly more positive attitudes toward the prompts than learners in the self-regulated conditions. Finally, the continuing motivation was statistically significantly stronger in learners who viewed textual prompts than in their counterparts in the pictorial prompt groups. Introduction and Related Work The computer-based instruction of electrical circuit analysis techniques has received a significant amount of interest over the last fifteen years, (see for instance Coulon, Forte & Rivera , 1993; Hanrahan & Caetano, 1989; Yoshikawa, Shintani & Ohba, 1992). A wide variety of computer-based instruction and tutoring systems with the aim to teach circuit analysis techniques and to provide opportunities for practicing circuit analysis have been developed and evaluated. Many of the developed systems interact with the learner to aid in impart ing the knowledge of the circuit analysis techniques and to provide feedback on learner input to practice problems. In the case of incorrect solutions the feedback is oftentimes accompanied by instructional prompts (help). These learner-program interactions are in the form of text and/or graphics and are controlled (presented) by the learner or the system. The impact of both the format and the control (presentation) of the instructional prompts in circuit analysis tutoring systems have not been previously examined in detail. This study extends the existing literature on computer-based instruction of electrical circuit analysis in that it examines the impact of the presentation and the format of the instructional prompts in electrical circuit tutoring systems . Schnackenberg, Sullivan, Leader, and Jones, (1998) provide an extensive overview of different studies on the control approaches up to their time of writing. More recently, Brown (2001) found that leaving the navigation of computer-based training to the learner tends to interfere with the instructional integrity of the learning environment, which is counterproductive. Schnackenberg et al. (1998) found that with learner control, the learners tend to skip practice examples, which tends to negatively affect learning. In the context of the highly structured content domain of the present study, namely electrical circuit analysis techniques, it appears that program controlled instructional design and navigation would be beneficial (Lawless & Kulikowich, 1998). Furthermore, program control might be especially advantageous for learners with low levels of prior knowledge in the domain area (Shin, Schallert & Savenye, 1994). Against this background, it is reasonable to assume that both subject-matter novices as well as technology neophytes should benefit from a program-control design. Overall, the issue of learner vs. external control has so far been primarily investigated in the context of navigating the instructional and/or practice material. We are not aware of a study on the impact of learner vs. external control of the provisioning of instructional prompts within a given practice problem, which is the focus of this study. How should the highly structured content on circuit analysis techniques be presented to learners in order to foster their initial knowledge acquisition and to introduce them to structured, algorithmic problem solving associated with electrical circuits? One theoretical approach that offers some guidance in this area is cognitive load theory, which provides the general guideline that the limited capacity of the working memory has",

Semi-structured group interviews were used to tease out the SRL strategies utilised by students from two different schools. SRL strategies were embedded in the CBLE as instructional prompts created for the purpose of assisting students during task completion. Students were then asked to reflect and comment on their work to identify SRL strategies they utilised in their learning. Findings demonstrate a range of SRL behaviours conveyed by students in the areas of planning for learning tasks, monitoring their learning, and reflection on their learning. The study highlights the importance of SRL strategies in Social Studies education to improve student learning.",

        "abstract": "Writing teacher educators often notice puzzling disconnects between what we teach preservice teachers and what happens when they plan lessons, coach students, and respond to writing. We wonder: \"We constantly emphasized rhetoric. Why is he tallying comma errors?\" And ponder: \"We immersed them in writing workshop. Why are her students writing only for homework?\" And lament: \"Why assign a five-paragraph theme?\"When we designed this teacher research project, we were curious: Where do beginning teachers get their ideas about writing and writing instruction? In this article, we identify five resource categories-fifteen individual resources-that preservice teachers (PSTs) drew on as they considered student writing. Identifying these resources helps us better understand how beginning writing teachers think, and better understand some of the mismatches between what we teach and what they do. In turn, this understanding can inform our efforts to shape effective programs, course work, practicums, and induction support for beginning teachers. We discuss the resources by category, while also considering questions and surprises that arose during the project. Analyzing which resources our PSTs drew upon- and how they employed them-raised questions about our own curriculum and instruction, prompting us to reconsider how writing teachers are taught.Resources in Writing Teacher Preparation and PracticeOur research builds on literature that considers how writing teachers are prepared, how they use what they learn, and which resources they draw upon.What Writing Teachers \"Get Taught\"We know of no U.S. or international studies about what (and how) writing teachers \"get taught\" (in the spirit, for example, of Smagorinsky & Whiting, 1995). Hochstetler (2009) found that in California, writing pedagogies were typically taught in comprehensive undergraduate English methods courses encompassing writing, reading, linguistics, ESL, and grammar. In Ohio, Tulley (2013) found that many programs offered a course to prepare secondary writing teachers; topics included writing process, theories, teacher comments, ESL, reading-writing relationships, and grammar. As Hochstetler (2007) observed, diverse regional policies and trends cause significant variation.In their review of the 1990-2010 research on U.S. K-12 writing teacher preparation, Morgan and Pytash (2014) found \"only 31 published studies focused on preparing PSTs to teach writing\" (p. 30), including 5 on methods courses designed to help develop PSTs' writing identities and abilities. A sampling of publications beyond those reviewed by Morgan and Pytash indicates that writing teachers may also be taught to read for writing (Bishop, 1995); to understand writer's workshop, scaffolded instruction, and writing processes (Whitney et al., 2008); to assess writing (Dempsey, PytlikZillig, & Bruning, 2009); to evaluate language ideologies (Orzulak, 2013); to wield their authority as writers (Whitney, Zuidema, & Fredricksen, 2013); and to consider how digital literacies and social media transform writing (Grabill & Hicks, 2005). The National Council of Teachers of English's (2006) guidelines for teacher preparation emphasize that teachers should understand writing as inquiry and as a rhetorical, recursive, and reflective act.While this list may appear representative, diverse theoretical paradigms within English education and composition mean that seemingly ubiquitous practices (such as \"teaching grammar\") emerge quite differently across contexts or situations, depending on the theoretical underpinnings. Thus, PSTs must be equipped-ideally within \"conceptually unified\" programs-to navigate critically the sometimes competing, sometimes complementary theories and practices they will encounter (Bickmore, Smagorinsky, & O'Donnell-Allen, 2005). This critical approach, at work in our own programs, troubles the idea that teachers passively \"get taught\"; it instead uses constructivist methods and negotiation of meaning within communities of practice (Wenger, 1998) to help PSTs build coherent frameworks for learning, teaching, and writing. \u2026",

        "abstract": "Generative large language models (LLMs) with instruct training such as GPT-4 can follow human-provided instruction prompts and generate human-like responses to these prompts. Apart from natural language responses, they have also been found to be effective at generating formal artifacts such as code, plans, and logical specifications from natural language prompts. Despite their remarkably improved accuracy, these models are still known to produce factually incorrect or contextually inappropriate results despite their syntactic coherence - a phenomenon often referred to as hallucination. This limitation makes it difficult to use these models to synthesize formal artifacts that are used in safety-critical applications. Unlike tasks such as text summarization and question-answering, bugs in code, plan, and other formal artifacts produced by LLMs can be catastrophic. We posit that we can use the satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers as deductive reasoning engines to analyze the generated solutions from the LLMs, produce counterexamples when the solutions are incorrect, and provide that feedback to the LLMs exploiting the dialog capability of instruct-trained LLMs. This interaction between inductive LLMs and deductive SMT solvers can iteratively steer the LLM to generate the correct response. In our experiments, we use planning over the domain of blocks as our synthesis task for evaluating our approach. We use GPT-4, GPT3.5 Turbo, Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada as the LLMs and Z3 as the SMT solver. Our method allows the user to communicate the planning problem in natural language; even the formulation of queries to SMT solvers is automatically generated from natural language. Thus, the proposed technique can enable non-expert users to describe their problems in natural language, and the combination of LLMs and SMT solvers can produce provably correct solutions.",

        "abstract": "Layout-aware pre-trained models has achieved significant progress on document image question answering. They introduce extra learnable modules into existing language models to capture layout information within document images from text bounding box coordinates obtained by OCR tools. However, extra modules necessitate pre-training on extensive document images. This prevents these methods from directly utilizing off-the-shelf instruction-tuning language foundation models, which have recently shown promising potential in zero-shot learning. Instead, in this paper, we find that instruction-tuning language models like Claude and ChatGPT can understand layout by spaces and line breaks. Based on this observation, we propose the LAyout and Task aware Instruction Prompt (LATIN-Prompt), which consists of layout-aware document content and task-aware instruction. Specifically, the former uses appropriate spaces and line breaks to recover the layout information among text segments obtained by OCR tools, and the latter ensures that generated answers adhere to formatting requirements. Moreover, we propose the LAyout and Task aware Instruction Tuning (LATIN-Tuning) to improve the performance of small instruction-tuning models like Alpaca. Experimental results show that LATIN-Prompt enables zero-shot performance of Claude and ChatGPT to be comparable to the fine-tuning performance of SOTAs on document image question answering, and LATIN-Tuning enhances the zero-shot performance of Alpaca significantly. For example, LATIN-Prompt improves the performance of Claude and ChatGPT on DocVQA by 263% and 20% respectively. LATIN-Tuning improves the performance of Alpaca on DocVQA by 87.7%. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of LATIN-Prompt and LATIN-Tuning. We provide the code in supplementary and will release it to facilitate future research.",

Quality of explanations was linked with students' performance in different types of assessments focusing on the content of the science unit studied.

        "abstract": "Purpose This study evaluated the effects of an automated, small-group intervention designed to teach preschoolers challenging vocabulary words. Previous studies have provided evidence of efficacy. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the program after doubling the number of words taught from 2 to 4 words per book. Method Seventeen preschool children listened to 1 prerecorded book per week for 9 weeks. Each storybook had embedded, interactive lessons for 4 target vocabulary words. Each lesson provided repeated exposures to words and their definitions, child-friendly contexts, and multiple opportunities for children to respond verbally to instructional prompts. Participants were asked to define the weekly targeted vocabulary before and after intervention. A repeated acquisition single-case design was used to examine the effects of the books and embedded lessons on learning of target vocabulary words. Results Treatment effects were observed for all children across many of the books. Learning of at least 2 points (i.e., 1 word) was replicated for 74.5% of 149 books tested across the 17 participants. On average, children learned to define 47% of the target vocabulary words (17 out of 36). Conclusions Results support including 4 challenging words per book, as children learned substantially more words when 4 words were taught, in comparison to previous studies. Within an iterative development process, results of the current study take us 1 step closer to creating an optimal vocabulary intervention that supports the language development of at-risk children.",

        "abstract": "Nine retarded or autistic persons exhibiting very serious self-injury were treated with several types of reinforcement procedures in a comparative study. During the baseline level of instructional prompting, self-injury occurred during 55% of the observation intervals, 57% during social extinction, 34% during differential reinforcement for non-self-injury (DRO), 28% during differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior (DRI), 25% during response interruption, and 6% during combined DRI-Interruption. Extended application of the DRI-Interruption procedure in the ward and class situations showed a mean level of 12% self-injury on the first day and 0\u201310% each month for durations up to 48 months while performed by the regular institutional staff. The DRI-Interruption procedure was more effective than the alternatives for most subjects and within 4% of the next most effective procedure for the others. The DRI-Interruption procedure offers a training method that is fairly rapid, applicable to diverse and severe cases, substantial in the degree of benefit, enduring in effectiveness under extended maintenance, and more effective than the alternatives considered here. Its principal disadvantages appear to be the greater training time required as compared with physical punishment and the extensive manual contact required by the interruption component.",

Our goal was to take advantage of natural language conventions to design an optimal prompting arrangement that would accommodate both novice and expert users. The conversational conventions we focused on included people's readiness to speak in response to a direct question and during an appropriately timed conversational pause. We studied these conventions in the context of an automated operator service. Our results indicated that a prompt-arranged as a leading question, followed by a brief pause and then a list of key words-met our goals for both the initial prompt and, if ASR failed. a subsequent reprompt.

        "abstract": "Detecting social bias in text is challenging due to nuance, subjectivity, and difficulty in obtaining good quality labeled datasets at scale, especially given the evolving nature of social biases and society. To address these challenges, we propose a few-shot instruction-based method for prompting pre-trained language models (LMs). We select a few class-balanced exemplars from a small support repository that are closest to the query to be labeled in the embedding space. We then provide the LM with instruction that consists of this subset of labeled exemplars, the query text to be classified, a definition of bias, and prompt it to make a decision. We demonstrate that large LMs used in a few-shot context can detect different types of fine-grained biases with similar and sometimes superior accuracy to fine-tuned models. We observe that the largest 530B parameter model is significantly more effective in detecting social bias compared to smaller models (achieving at least 13% improvement in AUC metric compared to other models). It also maintains a high AUC (dropping less than 2%) when the labeled repository is reduced to as few as $100$ samples. Large pretrained language models thus make it easier and quicker to build new bias detectors.",

        "abstract": "Two instructional prompting procedures, progressive time delay and the system of least prompts, were compared to ascertain which was more effective and efficient in teaching expressive manual signs to three adolescent students with multiple handicaps; two students had moderate retardation and one had severe retardation. The procedures were evaluated using a parallel treatments design. Results indicate that both the system of least prompts and progressive time delay procedures were effective in teaching each student eight manual signs of environmental objects. All targeted signs were taught to criterion and maintained throughout the study. However, when comparing the efficiency of the two procedures, data indicate that the time delay procedure was more efficient relative to the rate of acquisition (trials and sessions to criterion), errors to criterion, and direct instructional time. When planning instructional programs for students with handicaps, teachers must con sider both the effectiveness and efficiency of instructional procedures. Efficiency factors such as rate of acquisition, errors to criterion, time spent in direct instruction, and mainte nance of learned behaviors are all important factors when selecting an instructional pro cedure. Some instructional strategies are con sidered response prompting techniques (Wol ery & Gast, 1984). These techniques enable teachers to manipulate students' responses, thus increasing the probability that they will emit the targeted behaviors in the presence of instructional stimuli. Commonly used re sponse prompting procedures are the most to-least intrusive prompt (Csapo, 1981), the least-to-most intrusive prompt (system of least prompts) (Alberto & Schofield, 1979), and the time delay procedure (Snell & Gast, 1981). The present study addresses two response prompting procedures: time delay and system of least prompts. Time delay has been used effectively to teach a variety of tasks to stu dents with mental retardation and related de velopmental disabilities. Among others, these include instruction-following (Striefel, Bryan, & Aikens, 1974; Striefel, Wetherby, & Karlan, 1976), manual sign reading (Smeets & Striefel, 1 The authors are grateful for the assistance pro vided by Stephanie Godby and Don Cross, Ed.D, Chairperson, Department of Special Education, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky. 1976), manual sign production (Browder, Morris, & Snell, 1981; Kleinen & Gast, 1982), picture naming (Gast, Kirk, Schuster, & Wol ery, 1985), sight-word reading (Browder, Hines, McCarthy, & Fees, 1984; McGee & McCoy, 1981), requesting food items (Char lop, Schreibman, & Thibodeau, 1985), bed making (Snell, 1982), task assembly (Walls, Haught, & Dowler, 1982), and visual discrim ination tasks (Touchette & Howard, 1984). The system of least prompts procedure has been used effectively to teach a variety of self help skills and daily living skills including toothbrushing (Horner & Keilitz, 1975), put ting on one's own hearing aid (Tucker & Berry, 1980), mending clothing (Cronin & Cuvo, 1979), and laundry skills (Cuvo, Leaf, & Borakove, 1978). Cooperative leisure skills were also successfully taught using the system of least prompts (Nietupski & Svoboda, 1982). Kohl, Wilcox, and Karlan (1978) used a mod ification of both the system of least prompts and time delay fading procedures to teach manual signs to moderately handicapped stu dents. Although research has demonstrated that these procedures are effective in teaching a variety of skills, Billingsley and Romer (1983) report that \"it is surprising that systematic comparisons of those procedures, and explo rations of variations within methods, are ex tremely rare in the literature\" (p. 6).

In two studies, we experimentally manipulated key features of deliberative public engagement (information, instructions, and discussion) and measured impacts on cognitive-affective engagement and knowledge about nanotechnology. We also examined the direct and moderating impacts of individual differences in need for cognition and gender. Findings indicated little impact of information (organized by topic or by pro-con relevance). Instructions (prompts to think critically) decreased engagement in Study 1, and increased it in Study 2, but did not impact post-knowledge. Group discussion had strong positive benefits for self-reported cognitive-affective engagement across studies. Also, for some types of engagement, effects were more positive for women than men. When predicting knowledge, there also was some evidence that discussion was more positive for women than men. Finally, need for cognition positively predicted engagement and knowledge gains, but rarely moderated the experimental effects. Given these mixed results, future research should continue to test theoretical assumptions about the effects of specific deliberative design features.",

        "abstract": "This work examines how students learn scientific concepts related to the greenhouse effect by participating in scientific reasoning activities with an interactive model. A longstanding issue in science education research is the tension between teaching scientific content vs. scientific process or reasoning. Following instruction and experience, students are able to engage in valid scientific reasoning in familiar or simple contexts (Chen & Klahr, 1999, Kuhn & Angelev, 1976). However, there is still concern about overtaxing students' cognitive resources when they are required to engage in activities that involve using scientific reasoning strategies to learn new scientific content. Models are \"dynamic representations and provide a visual explanation of the underlying causal mechanisms and processes underlying scientific phenomena which are not directly observable because of their scale\" (Gobert, 2005). Using interactive models to teach science can help address the content versus process issue by allowing students to practice reasoning about scientific phenomena in rich contexts. In this study, students use an interactive model to learn about the greenhouse effect. Instruction prompts them to use a control variables strategy as they conduct multiple experiments with the model. The main goal of this work is to measure changes in students' content knowledge and scientific reasoning skills following a model based instruction experience.",

        "abstract": "The role of thinking-aloud instructions and prior domain knowledge in information processing and source evaluation during Web search Yvonne Kammerer (y.kammerer@iwm-kmrc.de) Knowledge Media Research Center, Schleichstr. 6, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany Peter Gerjets (p.gerjets@iwm-kmrc.de) Knowledge Media Research Center, Schleichstr. 6, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany Abstract about information quality (i.e., the accuracy, authority, objectivity, or currency of information; e.g. Rieh, 2002; Tombros, Ruthven, & Jose, 2005). According to Tombros et al. (2005) also the structure of Web pages (i.e., the clarity of the Web page or the organization of the information therein) is evaluated extensively. The aim of the present paper was to identify potential reasons for the divergent findings. Specifically, we examined the impact of the instructions used in the studies as well as of participants' prior domain knowledge on information processing and source evaluation during Web search, using a rich multi-method approach including eye tracking methodologies, log file data, and verbal protocols. This paper examines the impact of thinking-aloud (TA) instructions as well as of individuals' prior domain knowledge on information processing and source evaluation during Web search on a health-related topic. With regard to TA instructions, prompted instructions that entailed evaluation prompts (as used in some previous Web search studies) were compared to neutral instructions (in line with the standards defined by Ericsson & Simon, 1993) and to a silent condition. To measure participants' (N = 44) information processing and source evaluation we used a rich multi-method approach including eye-tracking methodologies, log file data, and verbal protocols. Results indicate that prompted TA instructions as compared to neutral instructions significantly increased participants' verbal reflections on information quality and on structural aspects of Web pages, given that participants possessed at least a moderate level of prior domain knowledge. In addition, prompted instructions resulted in less linear viewing sequences on the search engine results pages than the silent condition. Finally, the higher participants' prior domain knowledge the more intensely they scrutinized the search results presented by the search engine and the smaller were their average pupil sizes, which indicated lower cognitive load. The significance of the results is considered in light of methodological as well as educational implications. The Role of Prompted Thinking-Aloud Instructions One reason for the divergent findings might be a methodological one, namely that in the studies by Rieh (2002) and Tombros et al. (2005) participants were instructed beforehand to explain what criteria they used to evaluate Web information (Tombros et al., 2005) or to select good or credible information during Web search and to explain their evaluation processes in the form of postsearch interviews including specific evaluation-related questions (Rieh, 2002). According to the seminal work by Ericsson and Simon (1993) and the meta-analysis by Fox, Ericsson, and Best (2011), however, procedures for verbal reporting are only nonreactive (i.e., do not alter thought processes and task performance) when instructions to think aloud are given in a neutral way, by instructing participants to verbalize their thoughts per se. In contrast, procedures that entail describing or explaining thoughts and actions \u2013 as it was the case in the studies by Tombros et al. (2005) and Rieh (2002) \u2013 are significantly reactive, altering participants' course of cognitive processing and leading to higher task performance than silent conditions. Hence, the instructions used by Tombros et al. (2005) and Rieh (2002) might have increased participants\u2019 awareness of the necessity of critically evaluating the information retrieved during Web search. Indirect evidence for this assumption comes from the studies by Hargittai et al. (2010) and Savolainen and Kari (2006) that used neutral thinking-aloud (TA) instructions and only found few utterances related to information quality or structural aspects of Web pages. A first aim of the present study, thus, was to further prove this assumption by directly comparing participants' verbal utterances when given TA Keywords: Web search; source evaluation; prior domain knowledge; thinking-aloud instructions; eye tracking Introduction In recent years, the World Wide Web (WWW) has evolved into a major information resource offering easy access to billions of Web pages on almost any topic. However, as anyone can publish virtually any information on the WWW, the quality of Web pages can vary widely. That is, misleading and low-quality Web pages, for example, in the field of medicine and health care, are as common as those providing neutral, high-quality information. Hence, to avoid the selection and use of doubtful or even false information, it is important that Web users themselves critically evaluate the quality of information they retrieve from the Web. Previous empirical findings about Web users' source evaluation as indicated by verbal reports, however, are inconclusive. Whereas some studies indicate that Web users mainly evaluate search results and Web pages only based on the topical relevance or their ranking in the search engine results page (e.g., Hargittai, Fullerton, Menchen-Trevino, & Thomas, 2010; Savolainen & Kari, 2006), others suggest that Web users are also concerned to a substantial extent",

        "abstract": "Software development life cycle is profoundly influenced by bugs: their introduction, identification, and eventual resolution account for a significant portion of software cost. This has motivated software engineering researchers and practitioners to propose different approaches for automating the identification and repair of software defects. Large language models have been adapted to the program repair task through few-shot demonstration learning and instruction prompting, treating this as an infilling task. However, these models have only focused on learning general bug-fixing patterns for uncategorized bugs mined from public repositories. In this paper, we propose InferFix: a transformer-based program repair framework paired with a state-of-the-art static analyzer to fix critical security and performance bugs. InferFix combines a Retriever -- transformer encoder model pretrained via contrastive learning objective, which aims at searching for semantically equivalent bugs and corresponding fixes; and a Generator -- a large language model (Codex Cushman) finetuned on supervised bug-fix data with prompts augmented via bug type annotations and semantically similar fixes retrieved from an external non-parametric memory. To train and evaluate our approach, we curated InferredBugs, a novel, metadata-rich dataset of bugs extracted by executing the Infer static analyzer on the change histories of thousands of Java and C# repositories. Our evaluation demonstrates that InferFix outperforms strong LLM baselines, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.6% for generating fixes in C# and 76.8% in Java. We discuss the deployment of InferFix alongside Infer at Microsoft which offers an end-to-end solution for detection, classification, and localization of bugs, as well as fixing and validation of candidate patches, integrated in the continuous integration pipeline to automate the software development workflow.",

To achieve this purpose, survey research design was employed, and data was collected from 35 early grade English language teachers (population of the study) teaching at primary schools of Wayu Tuka district, East Wollega Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. This population was comprehensively sampled and involved in the study. Quantitative data was collected using questionnaire, and classroom observation and introspective interview were employed in generating qualitative data. The numerical data was analyzed using descriptive (median) and inferential (correlation) statistics while thematic interpretative phenomenological analyses was used to analyze the verbally compiled data. Consequently, results of the analyses showed that the target teachers had confusions in naming their perceived cognition about language and its instruction. In spite of the confusions, results of the study evidenced that the teachers exaggerated perceived cognition about their actual practices of teaching the TL and using it in its instruction was not supported by their actual practices of using the TL for regulative and instructional functions of its teaching. These findings of the study have implications for both teacher education and development and research endeavors.",

        "abstract": "Everyday teaching requires teachers to deal with a variety of pedagogical issues, such as classroom disruptions. Against the background of on-going calls for an evidence-informed practice, teachers should ground their pedagogical decisions not only on subjective theories or experience-based knowledge but also on educational theories and empirical findings. However, research suggests that pre- and in-service teachers rather refer to experiential knowledge than to educational knowledge when addressing practical, pedagogical issues. One reason for the infrequent use of educational knowledge is that acquired knowledge has remained inert and cannot be applied to complex situations in practice. Therefore, implementing learning with contrastive (i.e., functional and dysfunctional) video examples in teacher education seems promising to promote pre-service teachers\u2019 acquisition of educational knowledge. The 2\u00d72-intervention study (N = 220) investigated the effects of the video sequence (dysfunctional-functional/functional-dysfunctional) and of video analysis prompts (with/without) on learning outcomes (concept knowledge, application knowledge) and on learning processes (written video analyses). Results revealed that the sequence dysfunctional-functional led to higher application knowledge in the post-test. There was no sequencing effect on concept knowledge. Prompted groups showed higher concept knowledge and application knowledge in the post-test. Furthermore, both experimental factors affected learning processes, which resulted in higher learning outcomes. In conclusion, learning with contrastive video examples in teacher education seems to be more effective if the video examples are presented in the sequence dysfunctional-functional and if instructional prompts guide the video analysis. The results substantiate the relevance of instructional guidance in learning with video examples and broaden the scope of validity of the concept of learning from errors.",

The effectiveness of the system ofleast prompts (SLP), a concrete intervention strategy consisting ofa hierarchy of interventions from the least intrusive to the most intrusive, was examined. The six participants (ages>70) all scored in the severe cognitive impairment range of the Mini Mental Status Exam. A single subject multiple probe design across dyads was used to introduce the independent variable (SLP). The intervention phase required the application of a consistent sequence of instructional prompts: verbal, repeated verbal, gestural, model, and physical. Independence increased for each participant during the intervention. Results of social validity interviews indicated that family members and caregivers perceived the intervention to be valuable. Two of the three participants who received direct instruction increased independence in gardening and one member acquired independence prior to any intervention. Only one of the three participants acquired the skill during the observation and learning phase. Independence increased for the other two participants when they re-ceived the SLP. The findings provide evidence that a SLP in a dyad or individual setting can\u00a0facilitate the re-acquisition of a recreation skin in adults with cognitive impairments.",

We study this question by conducting extensive empirical analysis that shed light on important features of successful instructional prompts. Specifically, we study several classes of reframing techniques for manual reformulation of prompts into more effective ones. Some examples include decomposing a complex task instruction into multiple simpler tasks or itemizing instructions into sequential steps. Our experiments compare the zero-shot and few-shot performance of LMs prompted with reframed instructions on 12 NLP tasks across 6 categories. Compared with original instructions, our reframed instructions lead to significant improvements across LMs with different sizes. For example, the same reframed prompts boost few-shot performance of GPT3-series and GPT2-series by 12.5% and 6.7% respectively averaged over all tasks. Furthermore, reframed instructions reduce the number of examples required to prompt LMs in the few-shot setting. We hope these empirically-driven techniques will pave the way towards more effective future prompting algorithms.",

We present EDM3, a novel approach for Event Detection that formulates three generative tasks: identification, classification, and combined detection. We show that EDM3 helps to learn transferable knowledge that can be leveraged to perform Event Detection and its subtasks concurrently, mitigating the error propagation inherent in pipelined approaches. Unlike previous dataset- or domain-specific approaches, EDM3 utilizes the existing knowledge of language models, allowing it to be trained over any classification schema. We evaluate EDM3 on multiple event detection datasets: RAMS, WikiEvents, MAVEN, and MLEE, showing that EDM3 outperforms 1) single-task performance by 8.4% on average and 2) multi-task performance without instructional prompts by 2.4% on average. We obtain SOTA results on RAMS (71.3% vs. 65.1% F-1) and competitive performance on other datasets. We analyze our approach to demonstrate its efficacy in low-resource and multi-sentence settings. We also show the effectiveness of this approach on non-standard event configurations such as multi-word and multi-class event triggers. Overall, our results show that EDM3 is a promising approach for Event Detection that has the potential for real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "The current study used a video prompting plus least-to-most prompting treatment package to teach a 35-year-old Caucasian man with Down Syndrome three leisure skills. Each leisure skill was task analyzed and the researchers created brief videos depicting the completion of individual steps. Using a multiple probe across behaviors design, the video prompting intervention was introduced for painting a picture, listening to music, and taking a digital picture. In addition to video prompting, a least-to-most prompting strategy was used when the participant exhibited difficulty with completion of a step. Results indicate that the participant successfully completed steps of the leisure skills with the aid of video and instructional prompts. Leisure skills and activities have long been identified as a priority for individuals with developmental disabilities (Dattilo & Schleien, 1994; Schleien, Porter, Wehman, 1979; Voeltz & Apffel, 1981). Leisure activities are important because of the positive, beneficial effects on social skills, communication abilities, and overall quality of life of participants (Felce & Perry, 1995, Garzia-Villamisar & Dattilo, 2011). Unfortunately, adults with disabilities engage in very few leisure activities despite frequent opportunities to do so. Zijlstra & Vlaskamp (2005) found that persons with severe disabilities, in a typical weekend, spent less than four hours in leisure activities, although as many as 19 hours were available for such activities. Video prompting has been used as an effective method of instructing individuals with developmental disabilities to successfully complete a variety of behaviors, such as daily living skills (Cannella-Malone, Sigafoos, O\u2019Reilly, de la Cruz, & Lancioni, 2006; Goodson, Sigafoos, O\u2019Reilly, Cannella, & Lancioni, 2007; Sigafoos et al., 2007; Van Laarhoven, Kraus, Karpman, Nizzi, & Valentino, 2010; Van Laarhoven & Van Laarhoven-Myers, 2006), cooking skills (Graves, Collins, Schuster, & Kleinert, 2005; Mechling, Gast, & Fields, 2008; Mechling, Gast, & Seid, 2009; Mechling & Gustafson, 2008; Mechling & Gustafson, 2009; Mechling & Stephens, 2009; Sigafoos et al., 2005; Van Laarhoven, Chandler, McNamara, & Zurita, 2009), purchasing skills (Cihak, Alberto, Taber-Doughty, & Gama, 2006; Mechling, Gast, & Barthold, 2003), pedestrian travel (Mechling & Seid, 2011), and vocational skills (Van Laarhoven, Johnson, Van Laarhoven-Myers, Grider, & Grider, 2009). In video prompting, individuals are shown brief videos that depict individual steps of the target behavior. The participant is shown a video, allowed to complete that step, and then shown the next video for the next step. The process continues until the participant has completed the target behavior. Positive findings across studies suggest that video prompting is an effective method to teach new skills to individuals with disabilities and a recent review of video prompting studies indicates that video prompting is also effective for facilitating generalization and maintenance of skills and may The authors wish to thank the participant and his family for their participation.

In some recent studies, researchers have taught leisure skills to individuals with developmental disabilities. These studies are unique in that the leisure activities have involved the use of digital devices. For example, Edrisinha, O\u2019Reilly, Choi, Sigafoos, & Lancioni (2011) used video prompting to teach four adults with developmental disabilities to take pictures with digital cameras, transfer the pictures to a computer, and print them. Video prompting was carried out using a laptop within a room at a day treatment program, and all four participants mastered the skills. Upon reaching criterion, the authors demonstrated that the behavior generalized to naturalistic settings (i.e., participants successfully took pictures outdoors). Hammond, Whatley, Ayres, and Gast (2010) taught three middle school students with intellectual disabilities to use iPod Nanos to listen to music, watch movies, and take pictures. The authors utilized a video modeling approach, in which the entire target behavior is shown to the participant prior to attempting in the activity. Intervention sessions were conducted at the participants\u2019 school and video modeling was conducted on a desktop computer. All three participants learned to use the iPods when video modeling was introduced. Similarly, Kagohara et al. (2011) used a video modeling procedure to teach three high school students with severe and multiple disabilities to listen to music on an iPod Touch. Video modeling took place with an iPod Touch in the participants\u2019 special education classroom. The participants successfully learned to listen to music on the iPods with instruction and they were able to maintain the skill after the intervention had been discontinued. The goal of the current study was to expand on the previous literature by teaching an adult with developmental disabilities to engage in leisure activities involving a digital entertainment device. The activities chosen for intervention were listening to music and taking digital pictures on an iPod Touch. Painting a picture was also chosen as a target behavior. A video prompting intervention was implemented with an iPod Touch. It was hypothesized that the participant would successfully learn the leisure skills with video prompts in conjunction with a least-to-most prompting system.",

Opportunity to counterargue also increased resistance to persuasion; the counterarguing groups showed significantly less attitude change than the control group. Feedback, locus of control and instructions (prompted versus spontaneous counterarguing) were explored as additional factors affecting counterarguing. Those subjects who were told to counterargue on prompt, counterargued longer than those subjects who could interrupt the message spontaneously to counterargue. In addition, a significant interaction was revealed for feedback X locus of control. The literature on resistance to persuasion, reactance, cognitive balance and learning theory are discussed as a basis for the above findings.",

        "abstract": "The presence of a schema in a text promotes the comprehension and recall of the information it contains. The ability to extract a schema out of a text depends on the field independence of the subject. Thus field-independent subjects recall better the elements of a text that can be organized according to a schema than field-dependent subjects. The purpose of this experiment was to check whether the fact of guiding field-dependent subjects toward an activity of search and utilization of the schema, thanks to adequate instruction, would allow them to perform as well as field-independent subjects. 192 7th graders in three Poitiers junior high schools were subdivided into 4 groups. Some pupils had to read a text with schema and others without schema, and they were given either an instruction prompting them to search for a schema and use it (modified instruction) or no instruction (normal instruction). The intellectual and reading level as well as the reading time were neutralized. The results show that, when the text is subtended by a schema, the number of target words correctly recalled varies with field independence for whatever instruction. Moreover, in the situation without schema, the correlation between field-dependent and field-independent subjects\u2019 recall scores almost equals zero with normal instruction but is positive and significant with the modified instruction. The conclusion is that the field-independent subjects\u2019 superiority is related to a specific cognitive mode of functioning.",

        "abstract": "The joint multiple Intent Detection (ID) and Slot Filling (SF) is a significant challenge in spoken language understanding. Because the slots in an utterance may relate to multi-intents, most existing approaches focus on utilizing task-specific components to capture the relations between intents and slots. The customized networks restrict models from modeling commonalities between tasks and generalization for broader applications. To address the above issue, we propose a Unified Generative framework (UGEN) based on a prompt-based paradigm, and formulate the task as a question-answering problem. Specifically, we design 5-type templates as instructional prompts, and each template includes a question that acts as the driver to teach UGEN to grasp the paradigm, options that list the candidate intents or slots to reduce the answer search space, and the context denotes original utterance. Through the instructional prompts, UGEN is guided to understand intents, slots, and their implicit correlations. On two popular multi-intent benchmark datasets, experimental results demonstrate that UGEN achieves new SOTA performances on full-data and surpasses the baselines by a large margin on 5-shot (28.1%) and 10-shot (23%) scenarios, which verify that UGEN is robust and effective.",

District administrators have realized that the quality of instruction rests not only with the teacher, but with the support staff as well. Supervisors and other mid-management personnel have the responsibility to assist teachers in improving classroom instruction. This is an awesome responsibility for supervisors; they have often lacked the necessary skills to provide teachers with the needed help. There have even been times when assessing instructional competence was more a matter of personal style and interpretation than a clearly defined strategy. Although the primary justification for employing supervisors has been to help teachers improve their instructional performance (Oliva 1976), many theorists have referred to supervision as a \"reluctant profession\" (Mosher and Purpel 1972) or the \"private cold war\" (Blumberg 1974). Some educators view supervisors as having the potential for promoting positive instructional change; others view them as potentially dangerous. We perceive supervisors as the central agents in helping teachers achieve their instructional best. There is a growing body of knowledge to assist supervisors in this function.

During baseline, target employees asked a mean of 26% of customers to enroll in the credit card program. Following intervention, target employees asked a mean of 84% of customers to enroll in the credit card program.

The majority of studies were single-subject experimental-design studies. Three were small case series (e.g. 2 or 3 participants), three contained 7 or 8 participants, and just one study included 12 participants. Outcome measures varied across the studies: (a) a focus on elimination or reduction in drooling; (b) an increase in swallowing; (c) improved head control and imitative vocalization; (d) mouth closure; and (e) a variety of self-management behaviors including chin and mouth wiping. Follow-up varied from 1\u20133 data points, with no consistency as to the duration of follow-up. The shortest and longest follow-ups were 1 week and 52 weeks. Definitions of drooling varied across studies and included descriptors of the quantity of drool, the frequency of drool, and the wetness of clothing or bibs. Interobserver reliability (mean %) was not reported for five studies and was reported as satisfactory for the remainder. The MBLR scores were summed and divided by the number of behaviors, settings, and participants.

In this paper, we resort to establish connections between multi-modality video tracks, including Vision, Audio, and Subtitle, and Text by exploring an automatically generated large-scale omni-modality video caption dataset called VAST-27M. Specifically, we first collect 27 million open-domain video clips and separately train a vision and an audio captioner to generate vision and audio captions. Then, we employ an off-the-shelf Large Language Model (LLM) to integrate the generated captions, together with subtitles and instructional prompts into omni-modality captions. Based on the proposed VAST-27M dataset, we train an omni-modality video-text foundational model named VAST, which can perceive and process vision, audio, and subtitle modalities from video, and better support various tasks including vision-text, audio-text, and multi-modal video-text tasks (retrieval, captioning and QA). Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed VAST-27M corpus and VAST foundation model. VAST achieves 22 new state-of-the-art results on various cross-modality benchmarks. Code, model and dataset will be released at https://github.com/TXH-mercury/VAST.",

In response to the impetus to have a framework for the development of online courses, a seminar series based on the Seven Principles of Undergraduate Education was developed. On the basis of the pedagogical principles presented during the seminar series, the online nursing research course was redesigned to be more learner-centered by increasing student-to-student and student-to-faculty interaction. Seven interactive modules were developed to address students' diverse learning styles.

Lyons This study examined how three different pre-reading (or relevance) instructions led to different learning outcomes for middle school students reading science texts on the topic of sweetness. The first was a generic instruction to read for understanding. The second prompted students to form a holistic explanation of the topic of sweetness, and the third instruction prompted students to focus on the core scientific principle of the relationship between structure and function. The latter two were specifically designed to align with science disciplinary goals. A comparison of the three treatments found that the generic instruction and the structure-function instruction led to better learning outcomes, measured by recall, short-answer performance questions, and a traditional multiple-choice/short-answer assessment. A qualitative analysis of the data also revealed some small yet notable differences in the recall pattern of students, such as an increased recall of key ideas for the structure-function instruction. This effect was seen predominantly for higher-skilled readers. The results suggest the possibility that relevance instructions targeting core ideas may help to orient students to the key ideas and explanations in scientific text, especially for higher-skilled readers, and indirectly highlights some of the challenges for students with less reading competencies. Overall, this study provides greater insight into how middleschool students read science texts, the effectiveness of instructor-provided relevance instructions in promoting (higher-level) comprehension of science texts, and implications for teachers on how to use texts in science instruction.",

        "abstract": "We provide a conceptual model for understanding the role of stimulus control within directives and a rationale for the use of experimental analysis methodology to assess the effects of task directives on the accuracy of task completion and the early development of noncompliance in young children. An overview of the interaction between organism variables (e.g., skill deficits such as language disorders), idiosyncratic histories of reinforcement during demand situations, and the specific type of directive used during demand situations will be discussed along with a brief review of relevant studies. Some directions for future research on early childhood noncompliance and related behaviors are discussed. ********** Catania (1994) defined stimulus control as an antecedent stimulus event that sets the occasion for a specific response. Therefore, when a specific response occurs following the presentation of a specific stimulus (e.g., instructional prompt), but not in the presence of another stimulus, then the response is considered to be under stimulus control. For example, when a room becomes cluttered and disorganized, this stimulus may serve as a discriminative stimulus (SD) for the individual to clean the room. In this case, the cluttered room is a cue to the individual to clean it up, if cleaning up has historically been associated with reinforcement (e.g., parental praise). For some children, however, the natural situation (a cluttered room) does not function as an SD, and additional prompting (e.g., instructions from the parents) is required to set the occasion for the desired behavior to be emitted. The type of additional cue or instructional prompt provided to the child may have a substantial effect on the behavior or chain of behavior that follows the instructional prompt (see Figure 1). If the child is provided with an effective instructional prompt that has historically been associated with reinforcement, this type of instructional prompt will set the occasion for a chain of behavior that begins with the child discriminating the task requirements, completing the task accurately, and then receiving reinforcement through a variety of operant mechanisms such as parental praise and access to preferred activities. In this case, we can say that the child has complied. However, if the child has a history of being provided with ineffective stimulus prompts that do not guide the child in discriminating the task requirements, these types of prompts may produce a different chain of behavior that is perceived by caregivers as noncompliance. If the child is not able to discriminate the task requirements, the parent may assume that the child is displaying noncompliant behavior, and the parent then provides various forms of redirection or punishment (e.g., reprimands, removal of preferred activities, physical punishment). Over time, the presentation of prompts is repeatedly paired with extinction or punishment, leading to avoidance or escape-maintained problem behavior. In this case, the child is repeatedly exposed to ineffective directives and then punished for perceived noncompliance. Thus, care providers may inadvertently shape a chain of problematic behaviors that are maintained by negative reinforcement (e.g., the child may display disruptive behavior to escape completing the demand). [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] In this conceptual model, compliance can be defined as consisting of two distinct behaviors: (a) discriminating the components presented in the instructional prompt and (b) performing the specific acts requested (Richman et al., in review). Two distinctly different sets of outcomes for each chain of behavior are shown in the bottom of Figure 1. For compliant behavior (behavior chain A), ongoing compliance is maintained by positive reinforcement. Of equal importance, the pairing of positive reinforcement with task directives assists the child to discriminate the SDs present in the natural situation, which may reduce the future need for task directives delivered by the care provider. \u2026",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a system involving task-dependent multimedia messages on an automation-intensive production line in a modern manufacturing plant. In order to minimize the mistakes by operators while performing a small percentage of essential (but inevitable) non-automated tasks, a PC-based Intelligent Multimedia Prompt System (IMPS) was conceived. The IMPS is designed to help the operators by reminding them of the steps involved when performing specific nonautomated tasks. The three main features of the IMPS are task instructions, interrupt handling and management information. Task instructions prompt the operator about the tasks to be performed. Interrupt handling caters to operations such as abrupt termination of tasks due to unforeseen circumstances. Management information provides task-related information to the supervisors. The IMPS design includes visual displays to correspond with auditory prompt messages. The IMPS was developed for handling manual interventional tasks in the production line of a local manufacturing plant. Laboratory testing and preliminary results indicate that the system is helpful in minimizing human errors.",

        "abstract": "Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task which involves four elements from user-generated texts:aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, and sentiment polarity. Most computational approaches focus on some of the ABSA sub-taskssuch as tuple (aspect term, sentiment polarity) or triplet (aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity) extraction using either pipeline or joint modeling approaches. Recently, generative approaches have been proposed to extract all four elements as (one or more) quadrupletsfrom text as a single task. In this work, we take a step further and propose a unified framework for solving ABSA, and the associated sub-tasksto improve the performance in few-shot scenarios. To this end, we fine-tune a T5 model with instructional prompts in a multi-task learning fashion covering all the sub-tasks, as well as the entire quadruple prediction task. In experiments with multiple benchmark datasets, we show that the proposed multi-task prompting approach brings performance boost (by absolute 8.29 F1) in the few-shot learning setting.",

Constraints associated with the context window length and computational costs encourage the development of compressed prompts. Existing methods rely heavily on training embeddings, which are designed to accommodate multiple token meanings. This presents challenges in terms of interpretability, a fixed number of embedding tokens, reusability across different LMs, and inapplicability when interacting with black-box APIs. This study proposes prompt compression with reinforcement learning (PCRL), a novel discrete prompt compression method that addresses these issues. PCRL employs a computationally efficient policy network that directly edits prompts. The PCRL training approach can be flexibly applied to various types of LMs, as well as decoder-only and encoder-decoder architecture, and can be trained without gradient access to LMs or labeled data. PCRL achieves an average reduction of 24.6% in token count across various instruction prompts while preserving performance. Further, we demonstrate that the learned policy can be transferred to larger LMs, and through various analyses, we aid the understanding of token importance within prompts.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation remains a leading cause of death in the United States. Although early defibrillation has been identified as the single most important intervention to improve survival, fewer than 5% of the 250 000 persons who experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest each year survive to hospital discharge (1). It has been estimated that chances for survival decrease approximately 7% to 10% with each passing minute and that survival rates after 12 minutes are only 2% to 5% (2). These findings contrast with the high survival rates observed when defibrillation is immediately available. For example, in rehabilitation facilities with immediate access to defibrillators, survival rates of over 80% have been reported (3, 4). The American Heart Association (AHA) recognized the importance of early defibrillation and, in the early 1990s, challenged the medical industry to develop defibrillators that could be deployed in public places, making early defibrillation widespread and increasing chances of survival after cardiac arrest. The medical industry answered this challenge, which is known as the Public Access Defibrillation initiative, by developing the modern automated external defibrillator (AED). The recent AHA guidelines for emergency cardiac care place increased emphasis on the importance of early defibrillation and recommend AED training (5). The guidelines state that public access defibrillation, which places AEDs in the hands of trained laypersons, has the potential to be the single greatest advance in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest since the development of CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation]. Working knowledge about AEDs will become crucial for all physicians. On a local level, physicians will be asked to help determine and oversee placement of AEDs in existing emergency medical services, as well as in strategic locations, such as local businesses, schools, and nursing homes. Also, physicians' individual patients may become more interested in obtaining their own personal AEDs (6). Finally, as AEDs become more widely available, physicians can expect to use them directly to aid persons who have had cardiac arrests. One study that monitored domestic airlines over a 2-year period found that volunteer physicians provided onboard emergency medical care when needed in more than 85% of cases (7). In this review, we provide general information on AED technology and operation, summarize the experience of AED trials (in emergency medical systems and in special environments), and discuss legislative and legal concerns. Methods We searched MEDLINE for relevant studies by using the term electric countershock in conjunction with the terms emergency medical services, biphasic waveform, heart arrest, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Only English-language articles were considered for inclusion. Case reports and series, clinical trials, letters to the editor, and review articles in peer-reviewed journals were selected. Conference proceedings and bibliographies of reviews were searched for appropriate articles. Articles were screened for relevance on the basis of the title and abstract. Product information for AEDs was obtained from official specification documents provided by the manufacturers (Table) Table. Commercially Available Devices Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration TableContinued Attributes and Technology The AHA Task Force (8) listed qualities that an ideal AED should possess in order to be compatible with the goal of public access defibrillation. An ideal AED should be easy to use, small, light, rugged, low maintenance, inexpensive, and self-testing; should be able to deter misuse; and should be able to provide data archiving and retrieval. Most modern AEDs meet these criteria. Defibrillation Waveforms and Energy Levels An important advance over the past decade has been the development of alternate waveforms for defibrillation (Figure 1). Traditional defibrillators used monophasic waveforms, in which electrical energy is delivered in a single polaritythe current travels in a single direction. In contrast, the newer biphasic waveforms involve a reversal of current at a specific time in the energy shock. Biphasic waveforms require less energy for successful defibrillation, which translates into smaller batteries and components and leads to an overall reduction in size and weight. Additional advantages are lower manufacturing costs, easier maintenance, and longer battery storage life. Figure 1. Different defibrillation waveforms available in automated external defibrillators. Top. Damped sinusoidal monophasic waveform. Middle. Truncated exponential biphasic waveform. Bottom. Rectilinear biphasic waveform. For monophasic shocks, the established protocol is to deliver a progressive escalating sequence, usually 200, 300, and 360 J. This strategy attempts to minimize the amount of energy required to defibrillate and theoretically diminish the potential for myocardial injury caused by the energy shock. By contrast, biphasic waveform devices can be equally successful or even superior at lower energy levels. Human studies conducted under controlled circumstances in electrophysiology laboratories have shown that 115-J and 130-J biphasic truncated shocks and 200-J damped monophasic shock have equivalent defibrillation efficacy (911). More important is the efficacy of AEDs during real cardiac arrests. Observational prospective studies have consistently demonstrated that biphasic devices using nonescalating sequences have high efficacy rates for termination of ventricular fibrillation (12, 13). In a recent multicenter prospective study, 115 persons with cardiac arrest were randomly assigned to the traditional monophasic sequence of 200, 300, and 360 J or the nonescalating impedance-compensating biphasic sequence of 150, 150, and 150 J (14). Although survival did not differ between groups, the 150-J biphasic sequence defibrillated at higher rates than the traditional shocks and the patients assigned to this group were more likely to have good cerebral function. This study supplemented earlier data showing that nonescalating biphasic shocks were at least as effective as, and possibly superior to, the traditional higher-energy monophasic shocks. Because biphasic defibrillators require less energy, lithium batteries can be used. Lithium batteries have a predictable life expectancy, do not require recharging or maintenance, are energy dense, and in some cases do not require special disposal. For example, one of the most popular AED models on the market uses a consumer-grade 13-oz battery pack that allows 5 years of standby, 300 shocks, or 12 hours of continuous monitoring. On the basis of evidence from animal studies, data from controlled inpatient trials with transthoracic biphasic defibrillators, and limited data from out-of-hospital experiences, the AHA has upgraded the use of biphasic waveform in AEDs to a class IIa recommendation (5). This indicates that a majority of experts consider biphasic waveform to be the standard of care and the intervention of choice. Automated Rhythm Analysis Automated external defibrillators have high sensitivity and specificity for identifying ventricular fibrillation. With the use of sophisticated microprocessors, findings are interpreted through analysis of surface electrocardiography. Various components are measured, such as amplitude, frequency, slope, and wave morphology integration. The devices also filter for extraneous signals that could interfere with proper interpretation, such as motion artifact, loose electrodes, and nearby radio transmission. In many field trials, AEDs have proven extremely accurate in the interpretation of cardiac arrhythmias (1520). The sensitivity for detection of ventricular fibrillation ranges from 96% to 100% (18, 2022). The accurate withholding of defibrillation (specificity) in appropriate rhythms (sinus tachycardia, asystole) approaches 100% (18, 2022). The rare errors in electrocardiographic analysis have been those of omission, where the device recommends no shock in response to fine ventricular fibrillation. Additional misinterpretations result when operators do not adhere to AED instructions (23, 24). Ease of Use The name automated external defibrillator is to be distinguished from automatic external defibrillator. Unlike the automatic device, which delivers the shock without operator intervention after being turned on, the automated device only advises a shock by a voice and text prompt; it requires the operator to take the final step of pressing the shock button. Manufacturers have made AEDs as simple to use as possible by incorporating four universal steps (Figure 2). Figure 2. The automated external defibrillator. 1. Power on. This is accomplished by flipping a power switch or by lifting the monitor cover. Turning on the device initiates a series of voice prompts that guides the user through the operation sequence. 2. Attach electrode pads. Voice prompts and diagrammatic instruction prompt the operator to place electrode pads in an anterolateral position. Transdermal medication patches must be removed. For some patients, chest hair will need to be shaved. If the victim is wet or diaphoretic, drying the chest wall will help prevent arcing between the electrode pads. The pads and cables are preconnected in some models but not in others. 3. Analyze the rhythm. In some models, analysis occurs automatically after electrode pads are placed and connected; others require that the rescuer press an analyze button. Instructions are given to stop cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to reduce the possibility of any other motion artifact. 4. Advise shock. If the interpreted rhythm is ventricular fibrillation, the device will advise shock. For the shock to be delivered, the operator must manually depress the shock button. After defibrillation, some AEDs require the operator to again press the analyze bu",

        "abstract": "The overarching goal of this thesis was to investigate looking patterns in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterised by difficulties in modulating social eye \ngaze. Despite a large body of literature investigating where autistic individuals look when viewing a face, there is limited research into first fixation locations and into their capacity for altering looking patterns in line with an instruction. A novel prompting paradigm was used to investigate where individuals looked when viewing a face, how their eye tracking patterns changed in response to an instruction prompt, as well as \nbehavioural performance throughout the task (accuracy and RT). The performance of individuals with ASD and neurotypical development (NT) was tested. \nIn Study 1 I investigated how accurately and quickly autistic adolescents responded in a forced choice recognition paradigm, where either the eye or mouth \nregion of a face had been changed between the target and foil images. Critically, the ASD group were less accurate overall when compared to the control group, but no \ngroup differences were seen between the eye and mouth conditions. In Study 2 eye tracking measures of dwell time and first fixation location were also included and the same paradigm was conducted with NT adults. This group had an initial, and difficult to inhibit, bias to look to the eyes, even when prompted to look to the mouth. In Study 3 the measure of time to first fixate was added to the paradigm, together with development of a control condition, and the same pattern of difficulty to inhibit looks to the eyes was found in typically developing (TD) children. Finally, Study 4 demonstrated that comparable eye tracking patterns were found in ASD and TD children, including this difficult to inhibit bias to look at the eyes. \nIn summary, this thesis used a novel prompting paradigm and established an initial difficult to inhibit bias to look to the eyes, shown consistently across TD children, \nNT adults, and autistic children. Therefore, evidence from this paradigm indicates that initial spontaneous looking to the eyes might be an automatic response in autistic individuals.",

Musicians in the treatment condition, prior to practicing, read a 650-word excerpt that explained three component cognitive skills of music performance: goal imaging, motor production, and self-monitoring; their instructions prompted them to report their thoughts related to the three component skills. The musicians in the control condition received no such excerpt and were prompted to simply report their thoughts before, during, and after performance attempts to improve their targeted skill. Participants\u2019 written responses were coded according to the presence of seven characteristics, specifically four indicators of self-regulation and three strategies of effective practice.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper presents two experiments that examined memory performance and adherence to instructions for a group of preschool children (n = 12) in the presence of a well-behaved real dog, a stuffed dog, and a human confederate. The children were shown 10 objects in each condition. At test, the children were shown each original object along with a distracter and asked to select the one they had seen before. As we expected, object recognition performance was at ceiling and no effects were significant. Instructional prompts were recorded in two ways: General prompts included general instructions like \u201cFace this way,\u201d whereas Task Specific prompts directed the child to perform specific aspects of the task like \u201cPick one of these objects.\u201d The first experiment involved the use of three-dimensional objects and we found that for both types of prompts, fewer prompts were needed in the Real Dog condition, followed by the Stuffed Dog condition, and the greatest number of prompts was needed in the Human condition. The second experiment involved the use of pictures of three-dimensional objects. Again, for both types of prompts, fewer prompts were needed in the Real Dog condition relative to the other two conditions. The results of these experiments indicate that the presence of a well-trained dog reduces the need for instructional prompts in a traditional cognitive task\u2014 object recognition\u2014for preschool children. The common assumption that the presence of a dog can be distracting for children during the execution of cognitive tasks appears to be false.",

        "abstract": "DURING A HOLIDAY VISIT LAST WINTER, my aunt asked. \"What exactly do you do?\" As I explained the work the State Educational Technology Directors Association (SETDA: www.setda.org) does to highlight the power of technology in education, she quickly commented, \"I don't get it why is technology so important in education? We all learned without it. Is it because of all those video games kids play?\" Remaining calm, I started my answer by reflecting on my first year of teaching. As a new teacher, I was driven to help each and every student, and the only way I could do that was to look at the work of each child in my class. I arrived at school early, left late, and still went home toting canvas bags of papers and assessments to go over. Armed with handwritten running records, paper copies of quizzes, and an old green gradebook, I did my best to prepare lessons suited for each student, but as a novice teacher with analog tools and minimal training, I struggled. Today, life in technology-rich schools is different--better-for teachers. Handheld devices for reading assessment, electronic response systems, software programs for assessing and grading, and skills-based online resources provide teachers with an abundance of tools for evaluating students, producing information teachers can then respond to with instruction tailored to the needs of each student. With individualized instruction, students with different learning styles and rates can succeed in the same classroom. At-risk students, who would probably drop out of school, stay and graduate. It's well documented that success in elementary school is a good indicator of academic success down the line. Conversely, students who fall behind in their early school years are vulnerable to ending up as high school dropouts. And if academic issues aren't addressed promptly, they only intensify over time. According to a February 2006 fact sheet on adolescent literacy from the Alliance for Excellence in Education (www.all4ed.org), approximately 8 million students in grades 4 to 12 struggle to read at grade level, and a full 70 percent of US middle and high school students require additional instructional support to meet their learning needs. Not a moment can be lost waiting for standardized test scores or quarterly assessments to gauge student progress, especially for elementary-level students learning to read and acquire basic math skills. Teachers must assess students regularly to check for comprehension so that they can individualize instruction promptly. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] States throughout the country are now offering formative assessment tools to help teachers apprehend students' learning difficulties early on. Arizona, for example, offers an item bank located within its IDEAL web portal (Integrated Data to Enhance Arizona's Learning; www.ideal.azed.gov). Pre-and post-assessments and performance-objective snapshots are available to all teachers in the state. Similarly, Alaska has developed a bank of formative assessments aligned to the state's grade-level expectations in math, reading, and writing for grades 3 to 10. The assessments are intended for use by all Alaska teachers to guide them in differentiating classroom instruction. And last fall, the Pennsylvania Department of Education launched the Pennsylvania Value-Added Assessment System Performance, which empowers the state's educators with student progress and achievement data so they can make informed instructional decisions. Technology is impacting specific content-area assessments as well. For reading, many states and districts use the formal Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (http://dibels.uoregon.edu) to assess reading progress and help individualize instruction. DIBELS is now available through handheld devices, which enable teachers to quickly assess students and gather student, group, and class data instantly. \u2026",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to improve the listening-speaking skills of the 5th grade \nstudent of SDN Gabahan through the interactive language activities in the academic year of \n2010/2011. The implemented actions are expected to meet the criteria of interactive language \nactivities theories. The actions consist of games and songs. \nIn this action research, the data were obtained by conducting observations during the \nimplementation of the actions, interviews, taking pictures and holding discussions to the 28 \nstudents of the fifth grade of SDN Gabahan, the English teacher and the collaborator. The \ninstruments for collecting the data were an audio recorder, observation, interview and a digital \ncamera. The data collected were qualitative in the form of field notes, interview transcripts and \npictures. To obtain the trustworthiness, the researcher applied triangulation technique to meet the \nvalidity of the data. \nThis research consists of two cycles. The results of the first cycle shows that the \nimplementation of interactive language activities such as games and songs accompanied with \nmedia were effective to promote the students\u2019 listening-speaking skills of Grade V. The result of \nthe second cycle showed that the implementation of interactive games and songs supported by \nmodified media and simpler classroom English was effective. The class was more interactive and \nthe students became familiar in using English in simple communication. The indicators of the \nsuccess of the implementation were: (1) the interaction in English between the teacher and the \nstudents, and among the students were improved (2) the students practiced listening and \nspeaking enthusiastically during the classroom activities (3) the students could respond to \nEnglish instructions promptly during the teaching and learning process, both orally and \nphysically and (4) the students were able to use the English expressions appropriately in simple \ndialog during the teaching and learning process.",

        "abstract": "Developments in Outcome-based education (OBE) and innovative shifts in its pedagogical approaches have reshaped the learning environment of curricula at medical schools. This instructional design has gained popularity due to its authenticity and systematic approach. However, this needs organized supervision and faculty training in order to achieve the desired goals for the program. Aim: This article examines the evaluation of OBE at a private medical school in Saudi Arabia. It describes the curriculum review process and the characteristics of the curriculum reviewers involved. It evaluates the curriculum using Harden\u2019s OBE implementation inventory. OBE reviewers\u2019 satisfaction about OBE implementation was evaluated using the OBE inventory. Results: This analysis shows our institutional profile to be similar to the \u2018transition to beavers\u2019 symbol in Harden\u2019s representation. At the program level, the study identifies gaps and suggests suitable recommendations to enhance the enactment of OBE. Conclusion: We strongly encourage medical educators to apply the nine components of the OBE implementation inventory to evaluate their level of implementation of OBE. To further build up this model, the authors propose a mnemonic \"ADAPTIVE Species\" as an instructional prompt to develop these qualities in medical faculty. \"ADAPTIVE Species\" stands for Assertive, Developer, Assessors, Prime-movers, Transparent, Innovators, Vigilant, Evaluators, and Selectors.",

        "abstract": "Few professionals working with children and families affected by autism spectrum disorders (ASD) would deny that behavioral intervention is the treatment of choice. Programs based in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) methodology such as discrete trial instruction (DTI) and applied verbal behavior (AVB) remain popular interventions for children diagnosed with ASD. They remain popular to the extent that special education litigation has increasingly involved requests that school districts provide or reimburse parents for a program characterized by ABA. Several distinctions, important for school personnel and educational consultants alike, can be made between a these programs. These distinctions are provided along the following dimensions: curriculum, reinforcement and motivation, delivery of instruction, prompting and error correction, language acquisition, augmentative communication, and data collection. Key Words: autism, behavioral intervention, Discrete Trial Instruction, Applied Verbal Behavior. ********** Schreibman (1997) indicates that few professionals working with children and families affected by autism spectrum disorders (ASD) would deny that behavioral intervention is the treatment of choice. Behavioral treatment has been defined as synonymous with applied behavior analysis (ABA), and as the application of the principles of learning to human behavior for the resultant effect of improved socially significant behaviors (Schreibman, 1997). Despite some methodological criticisms of the research (Connor, 2003, Eikeseth, 2001, Gresham, Beebe-Frankenberger, & MacMillan, 1999, Gresham & MacMillan, 1997, Gresham & MacMillan, 1998), ABA-based early intervention is empirically supported in helping children with ASD to achieve significant gains (Herbert & Brandsman, 2002). Programs based on ABA methodology remain popular interventions for children diagnosed with ASD (Herbert & Brandsma, 2002, Lovaas, 1987, McEachin, Smith, & Lovass, 1993, Schreibman, 1997). Special-education litigation has increasingly involved requests that school districts provide or reimburse parents for a program characterized by ABA (Yell & Drasgow, 2000). For example, the New York State Guideline Technical Report for clinical practice of the assessment and treatment of ASD for children ages 0-3 years recommends the principles of ABA be included as an important programmatic element (NYDH, 1999). Given the increased demand for ABA methodology for preschool and school-aged children with ASD in school settings, it is necessary that teachers of special education and other school personnel understand the distinction between different types of programs that fall under the umbrella of ABA and what is implied when parents request discrete trial or applied verbal behavior programs. In their selective review of treatments for children with autism, Gresham, Beebe-Frankenberger, and MacMillan (1999) evaluated several programs categorized as comprehensive behavioral and educational treatment programs. These include, among others, the UCLA Young Autism Project (YAP), based on the work by O. Ivar Lovaas (1987); Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (Project TEACCH), based on the work of Schopler and Reichler (1971); and Learning Experiences Alternative Program (LEAP), based on the work of Strain and others (1977) (Gresham, Beebe-Frankenberger, & MacMillan, 1999). Since the publication of the Gresham, Beebe-Frankenberger, and MacMillan article in 1999, additional approaches considered behavior analytic in nature have come to the forefront. These include Pivotal Response Training (PRT) (Koegel, Koegel, & Carter, 1999) and Applied Verbal Behavior (AVB) (Sundberg & Michael, 2001). For some educators, the distinction among ABA programs remains nebulous. The purpose of this paper is to distinguish between two popular approaches currently provided for early intervention and school-aged children in home- and school-based settings: Lovaas' Young Autism Project (YAP), more commonly referred to as Discrete Trial Instruction (DTI) or Discrete Trial Teaching (DTT), and B. \u2026",

As self-questioning is a complex skill, many students can benefit from additional instructional supports, especially when they are first learning how to self-question. One such support is systematic prompt fading, an evidence-based practice in which instructional prompts are gradually faded until the student can perform the skill independently. This study used systematic prompt fading to teach fourth graders a self-questioning strategy to improve their reading comprehension. A multiple probe across participants design demonstrated improved comprehension quiz scores for fourth graders who engaged in self-questioning while reading expository passages. In addition, all participants demonstrated at least some generalization to higher-level content area textbooks.",

        "abstract": "Prompt tuning for large-scale pretrained language models (PLMs) has shown remarkable potential, especially in low-resource scenarios such as few-shot learning. Moreover, derivative-free optimisation (DFO) techniques make it possible to tune prompts for a black-box PLM to better fit downstream tasks. However, there are usually preconditions to apply existing DFO-based prompt tuning methods, e.g. the backbone PLM needs to provide extra APIs so that hidden states (and/or embedding vectors) can be injected into it as continuous prompts, or carefully designed (discrete) manual prompts need to be available beforehand, serving as the initial states of the tuning algorithm. To waive such preconditions and make DFO-based prompt tuning ready for general use, this paper introduces a novel genetic algorithm (GA) that evolves from empty prompts, and uses the predictive probabilities derived from the backbone PLM(s) on the basis of a (few-shot) training set to guide the token selection process during prompt mutations. Experimental results on diverse benchmark datasets show that the proposed precondition-free method significantly outperforms the existing DFO-style counterparts that require preconditions, including black-box tuning, genetic prompt search and gradient-free instructional prompt search.",

Watson Computer-based simulations effectively support the acquisition of scientific knowledge when combined with a guided learning approach. Active learning drives complex cognitive processes that enable the integration of new information with existing knowledge. The iCAP (Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive) Framework provides a conceptual model to describe different types of active learning. Computer-based simulations fit neatly within this framework. Similarly, self-explanation is a generative learning strategy that fits within this framework. Promoting self-explanation using instructional prompts is an effective method for driving application of the strategy. This study compared three combinations of self-explanation prompt and learner activity (closed prompts \u2013 overt activity, open prompts \u2013 overt activity, open prompts non-overt activity) when using an instructional simulation to acquire knowledge related to scientific principles. Outcome measures included pretest-posttest comparisons, cognitive load, and self-efficacy. Results of the study indicated that closed prompts were more effective in driving application of the self-explanation learning strategy and learning outcomes when used within the context of an instructional simulation. Findings were less conclusive in terms of the type of activity (overt / non-overt). Only the closed prompts \u2013 overt activity treatment supported the attainment of greater learning outcomes when compared to the other treatments. No significant difference in learning outcomes was found for the open prompts \u2013 overt activity, and the open prompts \u2013 non-overt activity. In relation to cognitive load, no significant difference was revealed between treatments. In relation to self-efficacy, no significant difference was revealed between treatments or between measures recorded pre-instruction and post-instruction.",

        "abstract": "Vision-language navigation (VLN) is a challenging task due to its large searching space in the environment. To address this problem, previous works have proposed some methods of fine-tuning a large model that pretrained on large-scale datasets. However, the conventional fine-tuning methods require extra human-labeled navigation data and lack self-exploration capabilities in environments, which hinders their generalization of unseen scenes. To improve the ability of fast cross-domain adaptation, we propose Prompt-based Environmental Self-exploration (ProbES), which can self-explore the environments by sampling trajectories and automatically generates structured instructions via a large-scale cross-modal pretrained model (CLIP). Our method fully utilizes the knowledge learned from CLIP to build an in-domain dataset by self-exploration without human labeling. Unlike the conventional approach of fine-tuning, we introduce prompt tuning to achieve fast adaptation for language embeddings, which substantially improves the learning efficiency by leveraging prior knowledge. By automatically synthesizing trajectory-instruction pairs in any environment without human supervision and instruction prompt tuning, our model can adapt to diverse vision-language navigation tasks, including VLN and REVERIE. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that our ProbES significantly improves the generalization ability of the navigation model.",

Students\u2019 repeated use of predictions, systematic testing, and evidence-coordinated reasoning often led to formulating new principles, generalizing from observed patterns, verifying comprehension, and experiencing \u201cAha!\u201d moments. Just-in-time prompts helped learners manage embedded cognitive challenges in inquiry tasks, achieve a comprehensive understanding of the model represented in the simulation, and show significantly higher knowledge gain. Just-in-time prompts also promoted rejection of incorrect models of inquiry and construction of robust scientific mental models. The results suggest ways of customizing guidance to promote scientific learning within simulation environments.",

        "abstract": "The following literature review discusses potential non-medical benefits that may result from child and adolescent interaction with animals, and the practitioner or educator preferences regarding animal species used in Applied Animal Therapy. Discussed below are a variety of research study findings regarding the potential relationships between human-animal interactions and the various social, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and personality developmental aspects in children and adolescents. These studies looked at human-animal interactions in the school setting, in therapy settings using AAT, and in the family home settings regarding companion animals/pets. The animals involved in these studies include horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, fish, and other aquariumdwelling species. Interaction with and preference for horses yielded the most significant benefits with child/adolescent development, followed closely by interaction with and preference for dogs. These studies address multiple factors including the owner attachment levels to the animals, child/adolescent preferences for specific species or no animals at all, and past/present history of household pet ownership. The research also addresses many aspects to child and adolescent development including, memory, focus/distractibility, self-confidence, self-esteem, social skills, attachment issues, depression, aggressiveness, and most notably empathy. The findings relay the positive impact that human-animal interactions can and do have on many aspects of child and adolescent development in many different circumstances. These studies showed that there is a positive relationship between child-animal interactions and child development, which is supported by researches, parents, and teachers. HUMAN-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS & CHILD DEVELOPMENT 3 Introduction What is the relationship between human-animal interactions and child and adolescent development? Before this paper, my knowledge of Applied Animal Therapy (AAP) was solely related to the potential for medical benefits. I was previously aware of the positive cardiovascular effects and illness recovery implications of interacting with animals, but I had yet to learn about any other non-medical relationships between child-animal interactions and the potential effects on the child\u2019s development. In searching for research to analyze this topic, I also looked to decipher what preferences educators and practitioners may have regarding specific animal species for use in Applied Animal Therapy. I collected a variety of research regarding the potential relationships between human-animal interactions and the various aspects to child an adolescent development. These studies utilized a variety of settings including the school setting, standard therapy settings, and private family home settings. Horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, fish, and other aquarium-dwelling species were all addressed in the following research, though some more than others. These studies address the children\u2019s level of attachment to the animals, their preferences for specific species, and their history of household pets. This research addressed many aspects to child and adolescent development including, memory, motor-skills, verbal development, distractibility, self-confidence, self-esteem, social skills, attachment issues, depression, and aggressiveness. Previous Research Findings Animals in the School Setting Gee, Harris, and Johnson (2007) completed a study of a group of 14 preschool children four to six years old. Of these 14 children, nine were identified as having learning deficits, behavior deficits, or underdeveloped social skills; the remaining five children had no reports of these deficits. (Gee, Harris, & Johnson, 2007)The goal was to determine if their performances in a series of 10 HUMAN-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS & CHILD DEVELOPMENT 4 motor tasks would be affected in any way by the presents of a therapy dog. (Gee, et al., 2007) The 10 tasks were paired up into five groups; \u201cThe five pairs of activities were curved tunnel and straight tunnel, high jump and long jump, roll-over and crawl, obstacle course and weaving, and balance beam and throwing\u201d (Gee, et al., 2007, p. 379). The children\u2019s performance speed and accuracy were evaluated and compared between the dog-present and dog-absent tasks. For the dogpresent tasks, the dog would perform the task either directly before or at the same time as the child. \u201cThe presence of a therapy dog served as an effective motivator for the children, who performed faster, but without compromising accuracy, in all tasks but one\u201d (Gee, et al., 2007, p. 375). Prior to developing this study, the therapy dogs and students involved in the aforementioned study, had been given the opportunity to interact on a weekly basis in therapy work and play. This interaction helped the children develop a bond with the dogs, promoting improvement in the children\u2019s speech patterns, as noted by both the parents and teachers. The teachers, therapists, and supervisors all relayed \u201cpositive impressions of the impact the dogs appeared to have on the children's social and motor skills following the games the children played with the dogs\u201d (Gee, et al., 2007, p. 377). The aforementioned study was designed to move forward and gain a stronger understanding of these positive perceptions. \u201cMotor behavior a central component of many dog-child relationships and the presence of a therapy dog is beneficial during the execution of gross motor skills tasks by preschool children. Given the strong positive relationship between the development of gross motor skills and language (Rarick 1980), it is reasonable to conclude that therapy dogs may be a useful adjunct to language education and development\u201d (Gee, et al., 2007, p. 384). Preschoolers exhibit a stronger connection between their motor performance and academic achievement than third graders do as explained by Chissom (1971). This describes a natural weakening of this connection with age, but does not deny the presence of the cognitive-motor connection in preschool aged children. (Gee, et al., 2007) HUMAN-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS & CHILD DEVELOPMENT 5 This next study was developed by one of the same authors as the previous study and has many similarities. Gee, Crist, and Carr (2010) completed two related experiments involving 12 children, ages three to five, which took place in the library of the children\u2019s preschool. They set out to examine the memory performance of young children when exposed to a live dog, a stuffed animal dog, and a young-adult man. The first experiment they began by showing each child 10 different three-dimensional target objects, then distracted them with a game, and finally re-showed each of those 10 target objects along with a new distracter object and asking them to recall which they had seen before. This was repeated three times, once with a live dog next to them, once with a stuffed animal dog placed next to them, and once with an adult man sitting next to them. When the live dog was present, the children required fewer prompts or instructions to complete the task. The second experiment completed by Gee et al. (2010) was conducted a few months later and was aimed to confirm the findings of the first experiment. The only adjustment made to the previous experiment was the use of pictures of three-dimensional objects, instead of actual objects. Again, the children performed better, requiring less prompts when the live dog was present. (Gee, Crist, & Carr, 2010) \u201cWoody-Ramsey and Miller (1988) argued that preschool children do not spontaneously restrict their attention to relevant stimuli, but that they are able to do so when the stimulus is highly salient\u201d.... \u201cIt is possible the presence of the dog provided that highly salient stimulus needed to help the children to restrict their attention to the demands of the task, which in turn required fewer instructional prompts\u201d (Gee, et al., 2010, p. 183). In this and the previous study, more prompts were not necessary for the \u201cidentified\u201d children, meaning that the presence of the dog may have increased comprehension and decreased distractibility. Wedl and Kotrschal (2009) completed a study involving 50 children in the school setting, ages three to seven. They evaluated the relationship between the levels of interaction with classroom rabbits and the children\u2019s self-confidence and overall social interaction. The study team HUMAN-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS & CHILD DEVELOPMENT 6 determined three different types of interaction: direct occupation with rabbits; indirect occupation with rabbits; and proximity to rabbits. This study determined that a strong bond between a child and a companion animal, like the classroom rabbits, is dependent on the child\u2019s social competence and levels of empathy. More confident and respected children spent more time directly and indirectly, but less time in proximity with the rabbits, which is opposite of than the results for the more reserved or solitary children. (Wedl & Kotrschal, 2009) the children described as more clam and patient spent less time with the rabbit in all three categories. The sociable cheerful children spent more time in proximity but less in direct or indirect interaction with the rabbits. (Wedl & Kotrschal, 2009) Children who have pets at home exhibited more integration in their class, and more overall social interaction and popularity. They spent less time with the rabbits than those kids without current pets. \u201cTaking care of a pet may indeed enhance self-confidence, social acceptance, and communication with humans\u201d (Wedl & Kotrschal, 2009, p. 394). Children who have siblings were more likely to spend more time with the rabbits directly, indirectly, and in proximity. The children\u2019s interactions with the rabbits were a reflection of their personal confidence levels and social abilities. (Wedl & Kotrschal, 2009) Animals at Home A study completed by Daly and Morton (2006) examined elementary students in the home s",

For third-party informants, such instructions have no effect on these outcome variables. Results of a third study are inconsistent with cognitive load as an explanation for these effects. Taken together, these results indicate that inferences, and not merely associations, spontaneously form when processing information about self-informants. The results also show that the inferences and judgments that occur in spontaneous trait transference are not caused by the misidentification of third-party informants as self-informants.",

As such, this study sought to examine LLMs' capability to generate empathetic responses in conversations that emulate those in a mental health counselling setting. We selected five LLMs: version 3.5 and version 4 of the Generative Pre-training (GPT), Vicuna FastChat-T5, Pathways Language Model (PaLM) version 2, and Falcon-7B-Instruct. Based on a simple instructional prompt, these models responded to utterances derived from the EmpatheticDialogues (ED) dataset. Using three empathy-related metrics, we compared their responses to those from traditional response generation dialogue systems, which were fine-tuned on the ED dataset, along with human-generated responses. Notably, we discovered that responses from the LLMs were remarkably more empathetic in most scenarios. We position our findings in light of catapulting advancements in creating empathetic conversational systems.",

A planned and unplanned oral task was used to assess students' productive stylistic knowledge before and after the instructional treatment. Performance on both tasks was then compared to a corpus of native French (L1) speakers (n = 12) recorded under the same conditions. As hypothesised, the findings revealed that explicit instruction triggered changes in students' productive use of the target features; however, their ability to align to L1 stylistic norms was mediated by two factors: task types and linguistic complexity of the stylistic variants. Additionally, although instruction prompted change in the use of these variables, some learners reported being unwilling to use informal features, suggesting that personal speech-style preferences may also moderate the use of specific stylistic variants and should, therefore, be further considered in research examining the development of L2 sociolinguistic competence.",

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models is becoming ever more impractical due to their rapidly-growing scale. This motivates the use of parameter-efficient adaptation methods such as prompt tuning (PT), which adds a small number of tunable embeddings to an otherwise frozen model, and in-context learning (ICL), in which demonstrations of the task are provided to the model in natural language without any additional training. Recently, Singhal et al. (2022) propose ``instruction prompt tuning'' (IPT), which combines PT with ICL by concatenating a natural language demonstration with learned prompt embeddings. While all of these methods have proven effective on different tasks, how they interact with each other remains unexplored. In this paper, we empirically study when and how in-context examples improve prompt tuning by measuring the effectiveness of ICL, PT, and IPT on five text generation tasks with multiple base language models. We observe that (1) IPT does \\emph{not} always outperform PT, and in fact requires the in-context demonstration to be semantically similar to the test input to yield improvements; (2) PT is unstable and exhibits high variance, but combining PT and ICL (into IPT) consistently reduces variance across all five tasks; and (3) prompts learned for a specific source task via PT exhibit positive transfer when paired with in-context examples of a different target task. Our results offer actionable insights on choosing a suitable parameter-efficient adaptation method for a given task.",

LTI was defined as not delivering prompt 30% of all teaching trials. An adapted alternating treatments design was used in the study. Three 5 to 6 year old male students participated in the study.

In time delay instruction, prompt is provided followed by task direction so students are expected to respond to the task direction correctly. It is one of the errorless learning procedures. The rationale of \"individuals do not learn from their errors but from positive practices\" is basically important while developing errorless learning procedures (Wolery, Bailey, & Sugai, 1988, p. 220). Response prompting procedure and stimulus modifications are the two main types of errorless learning procedures (Tekin-Iftar & Kircaali-Iftar, 2006). In response prompting procedures, the prompt is provided prior to students' response and they are expected to respond correctly whereas in stimulus modification procedures, prompt is provided to the stimuli and the students are expected to recognize the stimuli and give correct response. There are many different procedures in both response prompting and stimulus modification approaches. Constant and progressive time delay procedures are two types of time delay procedures. Fixed amount of time such as 4 or 5 s is inserted between task direction and prompt in constant time delay. The duration between task direction and prompt is called delay interval. The interval is used for giving the student a chance to respond independently. In progressive time delay procedure, the delay interval is progressively increased. Both procedures have been developed by using one of the main principles of applied behavior analysis which is known as ABC principle. The procedural characteristics of constant time delay procedure (CTD) can be explained as follows: (a) same prompt is used throughout the instruction, (b) task direction is used in its final form, (c) it requires two types of teacher behaviors known as \"0 s delay interval trials\" and \"constant time delay intervals\", (d) five types of student responses are possible during instruction. After the first published study mentioned above, in the following four decades many research studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of CTD, to compare CTD with other procedures in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, to investigate the use of CTD by paraprofessionals, peers, and siblings. These published studies have shown that CTD is an effective procedure in teaching discrete as well as chained skills to individuals with various disabilities and ages. CTD is successfully used for teaching discrete skills such as sight words (Gast, Ault, Wolery, Doyle, & Belanger, 1988), mathematical skills (Kircaali- Iftar, Ergenekon, & Uysal, 2008; Koscinski & Gast, 1993), community signs (Yildirim & Tekin-Iftar, 2002) and chained skills such as food and drink preparation (Bozkurt & Gursel, 2005; Fiscus, Schuster, Morse, & Collins, 2002; Graves, Collins, Schuster, & Kleinhert, 2005; Hall, Schuster, Wolery, Gast, & Doyle, 1992; Schuster, Gast, Wolery, & Gultinan, 1988; Schuster & Griffen, 1991); responding to the lures of strangers (Collins, Schuster, & Nelson, 1992; Gast, Collins, Wolery, & Jones, 1993), first-aid skills (Gast, Winterling, Wolery, & Farmer, 1992), shopping skills (Dippi-Hoy & Jitendra, 2004; Morse & Schuster, 2000), and leisure skills (Tekin- Iftar et al. \u2026",

We study two types of attack strategies: 1) replacing certain words in an LLM's output with their synonyms given the context; 2) automatically searching for an instructional prompt to alter the writing style of the generation. In both strategies, we leverage an auxiliary LLM to generate the word replacements or the instructional prompt. Different from previous works, we consider a challenging setting where the auxiliary LLM can also be protected by a detector. Experiments reveal that our attacks effectively compromise the performance of all detectors in the study with plausible generations, underscoring the urgent need to improve the robustness of LLM-generated text detection systems.",

        "abstract": "Introduction'Manuscript' is from the Latin phrase codex manu scriptus. Explicitly, manuscripts are works of any kind (text, inscription, music score, map, etc.) written entirely by hand. A medieval manuscript is one written in Europe prior to the invention of printing from movable type in about 1450. It also refers to the handwritten or typescript copy of an author's work as submitted for publication before printing. Given the recent development and adoption of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in almost all sectors of the economy, libraries also need to implement the use of ICTs to enhance access to their resources by users. One of such implication is the digitization of library collections. Manuscripts have been identified as rare and precious collections that are normally prioritized in most digitization projects in libraries around the world. Digitizing manuscripts collection has been found to promote greater use of manuscripts and to safeguard the posterity of the rare materials.The Library of the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) has an appreciable collection of rare manuscripts. In line with technological development, the library has since undertaken digitization projects for manuscripts. The digital manuscripts collection can be accessed from the library interface, available at: http://www.iium.edu.my/lib.Literature ReviewUsability evaluation in librariesThere have been tremendous amounts of works carried out on usability evaluation in the past. According to Pearrow (2007), usability is a broad discipline of applying sound scientific observation, measurement, and design principles to the creation and maintenance of Web sites to bring about greater ease of use, ease of learnability, amount of usefulness, and least amount of discomfort for the humans who have to use it. He adds that usability evaluation is not about accessibility, marketing research, or \"crafting\" the user experience.A study conducted by Yushiana and Widyawati (2007) evaluated the design of OPAC's interface by three of the ten heuristic evaluation proposed by Nielsen (i.e. visibility of the interface status, match between interface and the real world, and aesthetic and minimalist design). The study identified some weaknesses of the interface in terms of proper messaging system to inform users on the system's status during delays. For menu instructions, it was found that prompt and error messages did not appear at the same place on each menu screen. Also, the terms used in the dialog box are not user-friendly, the interface did not offer clear activation cues or feedback on when to start an action, the jargons used are not friendly, and menu title is not brief. They suggested five areas of the interface that need improvement: (a) to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) menu with clear activation to make it obvious to the users on when the next operation can be started; (b) to ensure that menu instructions prompts and error messages appear in the same place(s) on each menu; (c) to ensure a clear indication is provided to keep users informed on the interface delay; (d) to ensure dialog boxes are user friendly by using jargons familiar to the users instead of computer jargons, and; (e) to ensure terms used are simple, precise and concise.Beier and Vaughan (2003) have described a framework for interface design guidelines that attempts to extend some of the user interface principles of non-HTML interfaces (e.g. Java) to HTML-based Web sites. In their study, they suggest the Bull's Eye framework for user interface guidelines which consists of five layers i.e. \"Overarching Features and Principles\" representing site-wide guidelines such as use of natural language, minimalism, colour palettes and other aesthetic, and object versus action orientation; \"Combination of Page Flows to Create Interaction Patterns\"; Page Flows'; \"Page Templates\"; and \"Components\" which represents discrete elements such as buttons, text fields, text, and simple combinations of these elements. \u2026",

These adult students must be prepared to move into complex, high-needs schools without student teaching and often with little direct exposure to best practices in an urban environment. In an attempt to bring more positive and productive \u201creality\u201d into this pre-service year, urban K12 students were videotaped during a science workshop, then segments of this tape were streamed into the online segment of a pre-service course. Initial findings suggest that these 31 pre-service teachers benefitted from watching these videos that provided a rich, complex, realistic yet visionary scenario for analysis. These soon-to-be teachers then developed their own perspective on high-quality instruction. With minimal instructional prompts, these students were able to dig deeply into the activities presented, specifying engagement attributes, evaluating K12-student interactions, and drawing pedagogical conclusions. This article explains the video and its creation, the prompts that were used with the assignments, the resulting student commentary, lessons that can be learned from approach, and extended areas where these videos might be useful.",

        "abstract": "The effects of immediate feedback (corrective feedback and specific praise) provided through a wireless headphone FM transmission system were compared to the effects of delayed feedback (corrective feedback and specific praise) on inappropriate verbalizations using a single case alternating treatments design. The participant was a 10 year-old boy with ADHD. Results indicated that inappropriate verbalizations decreased during both conditions, although the decrease was larger using the FM transmission system. ********** In-class disruptive behavior can be a hindrance to both the teacher and the students. Such disruptions may be more serious for the student with special needs. One approach to dealing with distuptive behavior is verbal feedback provided by the teacher. In this regard, O'Leary and O'Leary (1977) stated that teacher feedback must (a) be delivered contingent on the behavior to be reinforced, (b) specify the particulars of the behavior being reinforced, and (c) sound sincere. In addition to the aforementioned feedback components, it has been shown that immediate feedback is more effective than delayed feedback in increasing desirable behaviors such as teaching how to deliver positive consequences and instructional prompts (O'Reilly, Renzaglia, & Lee, 1994; O'Reilly et al., 1992). For example, Lancioni and Boelens (1996) demonstrated the efficacy of immediate computer-delivered feedback in increasing the drawing accuracy of children with mental retardation. The research on punishment also confirms the importance of immediacy. Baron, Kaufman, and Fazzini (1969) identified an orderly relationship between the immediacy of the punisher and a decrease in responding--the more immediate the punisher the greater the reduction in responding. Similar results have been found in a classroom setting--the teacher's immediate scolding of inappropriate behavior was more effective than if some time was allowed to elapse (Abramowitz & O'Leary, 1990). Unfortunately, immediate feedback within the classroom setting presents several obstacles. For example, immediate feedback necessitates the disruption of ongoing class activities. Other students observe the interaction between the teacher and student increasing the probability that other disruptions will occur thereby potentially reinforcing the student's undesirable behavior. One tactic teachers have adopted is to deal with these problems by delaying the corrective feedback (Smith, Polloway, Patton, & Dowdy, 1998). Another tactic is to have paraprofessionals deal with the problem either in the hallway or in the classroom setting itself. The potential drawbacks to the student are obvious (e.g., removal from academic activities, stigmatization of student who is pulled out). It would be more desirable if the aforementioned difficulties could be minimized, if not eliminated, when error correction procedures are implemented. One such technique is the \"bug-in-the-ear\" device. This technique involves the use of a hearing-aid earphone that receives an FM transmitted signal (Miklich, 1975; Schwitzgebel & Bird, 1970). In addition to minimizing disruption and providing immediate feedback, the use of electronic instrumentation, such as the bug-in-the-ear device, can be used when individuals are not trained in complex intervention techniques (Coleman, 1970). Studies using the bug-in-the-ear device fall into one of three categories. One area of focus is on providing immediate and corrective feedback to counseling trainees with the overall aim of increasing clinical intervention skills (e.g., Gallant, Thyer, & Bailey, 1991; Hunt, 1980; McClure & Vriend, 1976). A second group of participants with whom the bug-in-the-ear technique has been used are parents who are provided immediate and corrective feedback when role-playing or dealing directly with their children; the focus is on increasing desirable parenting skills (Crimmins, Bradlyn, St. \u2026",

An interactive model technique was used to analyze the data. Seven English teachers of Islamic Senior High School in Indonesia took part in this study. The research findings showed that the reading course book has applied scaffolding types in its components, namely objective, topic, instructional prompts, practical consideration, vocabulary, text and context, task and activity, grammar, and material presentation. They were classified as means and goals scaffoldings. However, the application of those types was not as they supposed to be. The teachers and researchers, therefore, are recommended to develop a reading course book deploying scaffolding types as an artifact mediating language learning.

A study is presented in which the effect of giving prompts on the quantity and quality of academic help-seeking was experimentally investigated in a blended university learning course of educational science. Compared with students who received no prompts, students with prompts about the relevance of active help-seeking had better learning outcomes, participated more actively in online learning activities, more explicitly referred to learning contents in the forums and took more initiative in starting discussions.

        "abstract": "The 'Impression' section of a radiology report is a critical basis for communication between radiologists and other physicians, and it is typically written by radiologists based on the 'Findings' section. However, writing numerous impressions can be laborious and error-prone for radiologists. Although recent studies have achieved promising results in automatic impression generation using large-scale medical text data for pre-training and fine-tuning pre-trained language models, such models often require substantial amounts of medical text data and have poor generalization performance. While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown strong generalization capabilities and performance, their performance in specific domains, such as radiology, remains under-investigated and potentially limited. To address this limitation, we propose ImpressionGPT, which leverages the in-context learning capability of LLMs by constructing dynamic contexts using domain-specific, individualized data. This dynamic prompt approach enables the model to learn contextual knowledge from semantically similar examples from existing data. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm that performs automatic evaluation on the generated impression results and composes the corresponding instruction prompts to further optimize the model. The proposed ImpressionGPT model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both MIMIC-CXR and OpenI datasets without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning the LLMs. This work presents a paradigm for localizing LLMs that can be applied in a wide range of similar application scenarios, bridging the gap between general-purpose LLMs and the specific language processing needs of various domains.",

        "abstract": "The Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) market is rapidly expanding and becoming more mature. For example, OpenAI's ChatGPT is an advanced large language model (LLM) that generates responses for various queries with associated fees. Although these models can deliver satisfactory performance, they are far from perfect. Researchers have long studied the vulnerabilities and limitations of LLMs, such as adversarial attacks and model toxicity. Inevitably, commercial ML models are also not exempt from such issues, which can be problematic as MLaaS continues to grow. In this paper, we discover a new attack strategy against LLM APIs, namely the prompt abstraction attack. Specifically, we propose Mondrian, a simple and straightforward method that abstracts sentences, which can lower the cost of using LLM APIs. In this approach, the adversary first creates a pseudo API (with a lower established price) to serve as the proxy of the target API (with a higher established price). Next, the pseudo API leverages Mondrian to modify the user query, obtain the abstracted response from the target API, and forward it back to the end user. Our results show that Mondrian successfully reduces user queries' token length ranging from 13% to 23% across various tasks, including text classification, generation, and question answering. Meanwhile, these abstracted queries do not significantly affect the utility of task-specific and general language models like ChatGPT. Mondrian also reduces instruction prompts' token length by at least 11% without compromising output quality. As a result, the prompt abstraction attack enables the adversary to profit without bearing the cost of API development and deployment.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive teaching is considered fundamental to teaching quality and student learning. It describes teachers\u2019 practices of adjusting their instruction to students\u2019 diverse needs and levels of understanding. Adaptive teaching on a micro level has also been labeled as contingent support and has been shown to be effective in one-to-one and small-group settings. In the literature, the interplay of teachers\u2019 diagnostic strategies and instructional prompts aiming at tailored support are emphasized. Our study adds to this research by presenting a reliable measurement approach to adaptive classroom discourse in elementary science which includes a global index and the single indices of diagnostic strategies, instructional support, and student understanding. Applying this coding scheme, we investigate whether N\u2009=\u200917 teachers\u2019 adaptive classroom discourse predicts N\u2009=\u2009341 elementary school students\u2019 conceptual understanding of \u201cfloating and sinking\u201d on two posttests. In multilevel regression analyses, adaptive classroom discourse was shown to be effective for long-term student learning in the final posttest, while no significant effects were found for the intermediate posttest. Further, the single index of diagnostic strategies in classroom discourse contributed to long-term conceptual restructuring. Overall, teachers rarely acted adaptively which points to the relevance of teacher professional development.",

Methods and Materials: The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-4 application programming interface (API) was implemented as a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) storage server, which upon receiving a structure set DICOM file, prompts GPT-4 to re-label the structure names of both target volumes and normal tissues according to the AAPM TG-263. Three disease sites, prostate, head and neck, and thorax were selected for evaluation. For each disease site category, 150 patients were randomly selected for manually tuning the instructions prompt (in batches of 50) and 50 patients were randomly selected for evaluation. Structure names that were considered were those that were most likely to be relevant for studies utilizing structure contours for many patients. Results: The overall re-labeling accuracy of both target volumes and normal tissues for prostate, head and neck, and thorax cases was 96.0%, 98.5%, and 96.9% respectively. Re-labeling of target volumes was less accurate on average except for prostate - 100%, 93.1%, and 91.1% respectively. Conclusions: Given the accuracy of GPT-4 in re-labeling structure names of both target volumes and normal tissues as presented in this work, LLMs are poised to be the preferred method for standardizing structure names in radiation oncology, especially considering the rapid advancements in LLM capabilities that are likely to continue.",

They play an essential part as regulators, which should allocate resources steadily and issue instructions promptly to drive functional units. However, most of the recent research focuses on the operation at the software level or the scheduling at the SoC level, ignoring the impact of the microarchitecture and the features of controlled sub-modules. This paper analyzes the requirements of microcontrollers in the VLSI system with various constraints and conditions that should be considered in the hardware implementation of such microarchitecture. Furthermore, this paper takes an open-source design using RISC-V ISA as the prototype to implement hardware microarchitecture. This design integrates the techniques of out-of-order processing, which are usually used on superscalar processors. As a result, the design quadruples the number of pipelined instructions, greatly alleviating the stalling of the instruction stream with a maximum extra look up table utilization of 18.37% in FPGA implementation.",

        "abstract": "Traditional keyboards remain the input device of choice for typing-heavy environments. When attached to sensitive data, security is a major concern. To continuously authenticate users in these environments, use of keystroke dynamics can be a preferred choice. An integral part of user enrollment in a keystroke based continuous authentication system is the writing instruction (prompt) given to the users, to use as a basis for their improvised writing. There are many prompts possible, and they directly impact the performance of authentication systems. Hence, prompts should be designed carefully, and with purpose. In this paper, we bridge the gap between cognitive psychology and computer science and attempt to influence the mental state of the users to acquire a better authentication performance. We compare two kinds of writing prompts, creative and factual, for generating reference samples. In addition, we perform two robustness tests: robustness to dissimilar writing style (e.g., creative reference and factual test) and robustness to surface (e.g., hard surface reference and soft surface test). We collect data from thirty participants in four weekly sessions. We experiment with three features: key interval, key press, and key hold latencies. We use Relative (R) measure to generate the match score between the reference and test samples. Results show that creative writing consistently performs better than the factual one. Both writing prompts perform well with dissimilar style in testing, i.e., continuous authentication is found robust to writing style. Also, we find that the surface (hard or soft) used in testing need not match that used for the reference, thus continuous authentication is also surface robust.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment package in producing independent work by three children with autism with minimal supervision by an adult. The package included: (a) delayed reinforcement for on-task and on-schedule responding, (b) fading of instructional prompts and of the instructor's presence, (c) unpredictable supervision, (d) response cost for off-task responding. It was found that the treatment package resulted in increased levels of on-task and on-schedule responding during treatment for all three children with a supervising adult only occasionally present. Two children required minimal adult supervision in maintenance. Generalization probes showed that the behavior of all three children transferred across both novel material and a novel setting in the absence of adult supervision. Key words: Delayed reinforcement, fading supervision, response cost, autism, independent skills, intervention package, unpredictable supervision. ********** Numerous publications describe the variety of procedures that have been developed over decades to ameliorate the behavioral deficits and/or excesses that are typically displayed by persons with autism. The most effective studies have taught precisely targeted behaviors in structured educational settings (DeMyer, Hingtgen, & Jackson, 1981; Dunlap, Koegel, & O'Neil, 1985; Koegel, Rincover, & Egel, 1982). Despite these successes, learned behavior has not generalizeed to novel settings and/or persisted once the treatment contingencies have been withdrawn (Dunlap & Johnson, 1985; Dunlap, Koegel, & Johnson, 1987; Stahmer & Shreibman, 1992). Additionally, persons with autism frequently do not independently initiate tasks or remain appropriately engaged with materials even though they may have displayed mastery of the specific tasks in structured settings (Dunlap & Plienis, 1988; Fowler, 1988; MacDuff, Krantz, & McClannahan, 1993; Sailor, Goetz, Anderson, Hunt, & Gee, 1988). The presence of a supervising adult who wi ll prompt engagement continues to be a requirement for many persons with autism to function in their environments (Dunlap & Johnston, 1985; Dunlap, Koegel, & Johnson, 1987; Stahmer & Shreibman, 1992). Furthermore, people with autism may also have difficulty acquiring lengthy response sequences. Thus, even though a child with autism may have learned to complete a morning routine (e.g., brush teeth, get dressed, and go to breakfast), she may need prompts to initiate each activity or each part of an activity (MacDuff, Krantz, & McClannahan, 1993). Again, successful completion of the sequence requires monitoring from a supervising adult. Integration of persons with autism and developmental disabilities into mainstream society continues to be a dominant priority in the field of education. Simply teaching children with autism a variety of skills is not enough to prepare them for a functional life in society. For instance, it is important that persons with autism learn to display already acquired skills in the absence of a supervising adult. Krantz and McClannahan (1999) suggest that in order to program for integration the following six response classes should be addressed: (a) following adults' instructions, (b) exhibiting generative language, (c) emitting low rates of inappropriate behavior, (d) sustaining engagement, (e) responding to temporally delayed consequences and (f) generalizing skills across settings. If children with autism are to share the same experiences as their nondisabled peers, it is imperative to identify procedures to successfully teach these skills to them. As mentioned earlier, typically, the removal of close supervision, whether in group or in individualized settings, leads to the recurrence of stereotypic and off-task behaviors and a decline in appropriate, productive responding (Dunlap & Johnson, 1985; Marholin & Steinman, 1977). \u2026",

        "abstract": "Two hundred seventy 5-year-old children produced a copy drawing of a transparent glass mug with its handle turned away. In a factorial design three factors were manipulated to examine their additive or independent influence on the child's production of either view-specific or canonical (i.e., with the handle at the side) depictions: the content of the mug, the label used to describe it, and the explicitness of instruction. The results showed, first, that each of these variations in task demands exerted an influence on the canonicality/view-specificity of the children's drawings. Second, these influences were both facilitative and prohibitive. So, for example, general instructions prompted canonical drawings, while very explicit instructions elicited view-specific depictions. Third, each factor exerted an independent influence upon whether or not the handle was included--there were no interactions between factors on the production of the two types of picture. These results provide further evidence against simple associations between children's drawings and their cognitive abilities. They suggest that what children produce in studies of \"drawing\" may well simply inform us about the development of an understanding of adults' communicative intent.",

Although tasks and problems are a central part of teaching and assessments in the chemistry classroom, they may not engage students in deep reasoning or in a way that is intended through a task. Some problems may cause an algorithmic or a surface approach. Even with designing clever problems, students may not use a larger variety of chemistry ideas and connect them in meaningful ways. Here the idea of scaffolding students\u2019 answering process comes into play. Structuring students\u2019 reasoning process through instructional prompts or structured worksheets supports students in activating and connecting knowledge pieces in a more meaningful way and positively slows down their fast decision-making process. This paper will discuss the importance of asking questions in chemistry teaching and highlights the idea of contrasting cases, drawn from cognitive psychology, as a task design principle. In addition to having contrasting cases as a good problem format, the idea of scaffolding students\u2019 reasoning while solving contrasting cases through the use of instructional prompts that scaffold the reasoning process will be exemplarily showcased for mechanistic reasoning in organic chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The primary focus of my research has been developing psychological treatments for children who engage in extreme aggressive and antisocial behavior. Such behaviors are relatively prevalent (approximately 9\u201310 percent of children in the United States) and are among the most frequent bases for referring children to treatment (up to 33 percent of cases of children seen in treatment). The behaviors occur in both boys and girls but are much more prevalent among boys. In the long term, children with aggressive and antisocial behaviors are at greatly increased risk for mental health problems (e.g., psychiatric disorders, substance abuse), physical health problems (e.g., early death from disease), and criminal behavior (e.g., domestic violence, child abuse). The problem of aggressive and antisocial behavior is very costly for society because the children require many social and hospital services, are often taken to emergency rooms for behaviors that are dangerous or uncontrollable, are in special classes at school, and are in repeated contact with the criminal justice system. Until recently, no interventions had been shown to have impact on the problem \u2013 not medication, psychotherapy, special experiences (e.g., wilderness camps), or special diet. Contribution and Its Importance My clinical research has focused on children hospitalized or seen in out-patient treatment for extremes of these behaviors. The children get into frequent fights, destroy property, steal, set fires, and run away from home, in addition to exhibiting many other less severe but still problematic behaviors such as tantrums, oppositional behavior, and bullying. The constellation of behaviors constitutes a psychiatric disorder referred to as Conduct Disorder. As with many other psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depression, autism), there are varying degrees of severity and impairment. We have developed two treatments, referred to as parent management training (PMT) and cognitive problem-solving skills training (PSST) (please see References at end of chapter). PMT trains parents very concretely in new ways to interact with their children in the home. Parents meet individually with a therapist. The parents learn how to administer antecedents, such as instructions, prompts, or cues on how to perform the behavior; to focus the child on practicing the behavior by gradually reinforcing approximations of the behavior; and on consequences to increase prosocial behaviors by delivering praise and tokens. The therapist uses role-playing of parent\u2013child interactions, repeated practice, modeling of the desired parent behaviors, feedback, and praise.",

        "abstract": "In habilitative programs for persons with intellectual or psychiatric disabilities, direct-care providers, such as nursing assistants, therapy assistants, parents, and many others, play a crucial role in instructing and maintaining a wide range of daily living skills including communication, vocational, leisure, and self-care. Indeed, the success of habilitative programs is largely dependent on how effectively direct-care providers instruct their clients. To this end, most habilitative programs offer direct-care providers--or more precisely, instructors--inservice training in the basics of instruction. Training is usually more effective when instructors receive on-the-job feedback, but once training ceases, continuing with feedback to maintain instructor performance can be intrusive and costly in time and effort. Typically, feedback during maintenance has emphasized instructor performance (i.e., process) via instructors self-recording their performance, or via frequent recordings from supervisory agents. However, these procedures are not only costly to maintain, but the research has remained inconclusive about their usefulness. Furthermore, these feedback procedures could hinder transfer of control of instructor performance to more natural contingencies. Alternatively, maintenance can be approached by transferring control to more natural contingencies utilizing positive changes in client behaviour (i.e., feedback emphasizing outcome). \n \nThe aim of this thesis was to investigate more efficient feedback for maintaining instructor performance. \n \nFive studies are reported in which instructors and clients with intellectual disabilities participated in instructional programs in leisure, preacademic, and communication skills, in settings including a group home, family home, school, and nursing home. The instructors, who varied in instructional expertise and experience, ranged from paid staff to unpaid students and other volunteers. Intrasubject research designs were used with repeated measures of (a) occurrence and performance error percentages of instructors' verbal instructions, prompts, and consequences, (b) performance fluency (i.e., correct trials per minute), and (c) client behaviour. Instructor training included written descriptions and guidelines, discussion, and modelling of instructional performance, but the predominant procedures were on-the-job verbal feedback on correct performance of verbal instructions, prompts, and consequences, and instructors' recording and graphing unprompted correct client behaviour. Training continued until performance mastery was achieved. Maintenance was tested while instructors continued with their recording and graphing of client behaviour, but without feedback on instructor performance (i.e., outcome feedback alone). Also, effects of instructors' rating their own performance, and effects of increasing performance fluency were assessed. \n \nThe results show that instructors maintained mastery-level performance and correct client behaviour for up to 13 weeks with the recording and graphing of positive changes in client behaviour, that is, with feedback from client behaviour alone. Instructors' self-ratings, and increases in performance fluency did not enhance maintenance. \n \nThese results significantly extend current research in two ways. First, instructors' recording of client behaviour alone was sufficient for maintenance, and that instructors' self-recording or frequent supervisory feedback were unnecessary. Second, by measuring instructor performance in terms of occurrence, performance error, and fluency during training and maintenance conditions, a more comprehensive and precise description of performance mastery was obtained. A new graphic depiction of performance was tested and proved useful, particularly when performance was variable. The research supports the conclusion that durable instructional performance in habilitative programs requires (a) effective client behaviour change programs, (b) instructors trained to mastery with on-the-job feedback that emphasizes instructor performance including recording of client behaviour, and (c) after training, continuation of feedback via instructors' recording and graphing of client behaviour, with occasional independent observations.",

In addition to training, daily feedback was provided to supervisors regarding performance of their staff. Results of a multiple baseline analysis across teaching behaviors (instructions, prompts, and consequences) and content areas (communication and gross motor skills) showed that providing training and feedback to supervisors resulted in increases in correct teaching behavior by direct care staff. However, teaching behavior newly learned in one content area (communication) did not generalize to the other area (gross motor skills). Data collected on resident behavior showed small but noticeable improvement in terms of correct responses and attending behavior during programming. Results are discussed in terms of the benefits of a pyramidal approach to training institutional staff.",

Some children donated repeatedly following the prompting alone, while others resumed low rates of donation after prompting ceased. Of 10 children who responded temporarily to prompting, 4 increased their helping rates when praised but continued to donate when praise was discontinued. 6 additional children faithfully reflected the praise contingency in their behavior by donating infrequently in the absence of praise and at high rates when praised for donations.

By instructional prompting strategy of \u201cclues\u201d and \u201cmediators\u201d, the instructor invited the students to assemble hollow balls of C60 model made of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. By individual interview, Mind Map, video recording of instruction, recording documents, work assembling, pretest and posttest of learning achievement test of Nano Technology, and collection and analysis of scales of attitude toward Nano Technology, this study found that after learning activity of Nano Technology, the students\u2019 related learning achievement, attitude toward Nano Technology, modeling capability and STEM capability were enhanced. During the Buckyball model assembly activity by 55 students, the moderating model with \u201csoccer\u201d provided by the researcher could significantly help students enhance scientific study, construct the model, and accomplish 3D perspective drawing. The model-based instructional activity could enhance learning motive, learning process, learning attitude, and learning achievement of the fifth and sixth grade elementary school students. This study suggested that Nano Technology should be included in the curriculum of nature and life science and technology of fifth and sixth grade students, and the skill of 3D drawing should be implemented in the related courses. This study expects that the planning of the instruction can enhance students\u2019 scientific literacy of \u201cdesign and manufacturing\u201d, high-level thinking and cross-field cognition.",

However, it is unclear how the types of knowledge generated through each technique differ, which has important implications for cognitive theory as well as instructional practice. I conducted a pair of experiments to directly compare the effects of instructional prompts supporting self-explanation, analogical comparison, and the study of instructional explanations across a number of fine-grained learning process, motivation, metacognition, and transfer measures. Experiment 1 explored these questions using sequence extrapolation problems, and results showed no differences between self-explanation and analogical comparison support conditions on any measure. Experiment 2 explored the same questions in a science domain. I evaluated condition effects on transfer outcomes; self-reported self-explanation, analogical comparison, and metacognitive processes; and achievement goals. I also examined relations between transfer and self-reported processes and goals. Receiving materials with analogical comparison support and reporting greater levels of analogical comparison were both associated with worse transfer performance, while reporting greater levels of self-explanation was associated with better performance. Learners\u2019 self-reports of self-explanation and analogical comparison were not related to condition assignment, suggesting that the questionnaires did not measure the same processes promoted by the intervention, or that individual differences in processing are robust even when learners are instructed to engage in self-explanation or analogical comparison.",

        "abstract": "Providing natural language instructions in prompts is a useful new paradigm for improving task performance of large language models in a zero-shot setting. Recent work has aimed to improve such prompts via manual rewriting or gradient-based tuning. However, manual rewriting is time-consuming and requires subjective interpretation, while gradient-based tuning can be extremely computationally demanding for large models and may not be feasible for API-based models. In this work, we introduce Gradient-free Instructional Prompt Search (GrIPS), a gradient-free, edit-based search approach for improving task instructions for large language models. GrIPS takes in instructions designed for humans and automatically returns an improved, edited prompt, while allowing for API-based tuning. With InstructGPT models, GrIPS improves the average task performance by up to 4.30 percentage points on eight classification tasks from the Natural Instructions dataset (with similar improvements for OPT, BLOOM, and FLAN-T5). We see improvements for both instruction-only prompts and instruction + k-shot examples prompts. Notably, GrIPS outperforms manual rewriting and purely example-based prompts while controlling for the available compute and data budget. Further, performance of GrIPS is comparable to select gradient-based tuning approaches. Qualitatively, we show our edits can simplify instructions and at times make them incoherent but nonetheless improve accuracy.",

Knowledge of the scope of PTA practice introduced in the academic curriculum is mandated for entry-level practice. This study assessed the effect of a collaborative case-based educational intervention within the didactic curriculums of a physical therapy (PT) and PTA program on student knowledge of PTA scope of practice. Methods and Findings: A pre- and post-test research design was used. Students completed a validated survey exploring their perceptions of the PTA role before beginning the case study. The case study was a classroom assignment followed by instructional prompts requiring interactions between student cohorts three times over four weeks. Following case study completion, students completed the same survey. Independent and paired samples t -tests detected significant differences between and within groups ( p < .05). Conclusions: Based on the results, the case-based instructional model was efficacious in teaching both student cohorts about the role of the PTA. The impact was greater on the accuracy of the PT students, but PTA students became less uncertain in their perceptions. The effect of the clinical learning environment should be investigated to determine the impact on student perception of PTA role delineation following didactic instruction.",

The study reveals, on the one hand, that all pupils, regardless of their grade level, integrate temporal movements in their texts.

Reinforcements were being sent from England, and Gage was authorized to collect every corps that could be spared from necessary duty in other parts of America to strengthen his position in Boston and give protection to the friends of England. Although Gage had stated that 20,000 men would be necessary, Dartmouth believed otherwise. The acts of Massachusetts Bay were the acts of a \"rude Rabble without plan, without Concert, and without Conduct,\" so that in his opinion a smaller force if put to the test now would be able to meet it successfully. The people of the colonies should not be allowed to organize or to prepare their resources for possible conflict. Gage was instructed to arrest and imprison the principal leaders in the provincial congress whose activities were declared treasonable and rebellious. His plan of action must be secret until the moment of execution; Dartmouth expressed the hope that it could be accomplished without bloodshed, but if the movement should be a signal for hostilities it was better to begin now than to wait until the rebellion ripened. Dartmouth concluded by informing Gage that the Massachusetts Bay charter empowered the governor to use and exercise martial law in time of war, invasion, and rebellion, and in support of this idea he enclosed a copy of the opinion by the attorney and solicitor general which labeled the events in Massachusetts Bay as a rebellion.1 Although the initiation of the action was left to Gage's discretion, the tone of the letter indicated that Gage was expected to act; and these instructions prompted Gage to issue the marching orders which led to the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington and Concord.2 The letter signified",

This study was designed to evaluate the generalization errors of a preschooler with ASD. Following an intervention in which the participant was taught to request assistance with difficult tasks using a continuous reinforcement schedule, generalization gradients across levels of task difficulty were implemented to examine patterns of generalization. Initial results showed over-generalization of assistance requests and corresponding reductions in independent (the absence of any instructional prompts) task completion across all levels of task difficulty. A final phase involving competing schedules of reinforcement for assistance requests and independent work with video modeling led to improved conditional use of assistance requests.

In this paper, we quantify stereotypical bias in popular LLMs according to an Indian-centric frame and compare bias levels between the Indian and Western contexts. To do this, we develop a novel dataset which we call Indian-BhED (Indian Bias Evaluation Dataset), containing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples for caste and religion contexts. We find that the majority of LLMs tested are strongly biased towards stereotypes in the Indian context, especially as compared to the Western context. We finally investigate Instruction Prompting as a simple intervention to mitigate such bias and find that it significantly reduces both stereotypical and anti-stereotypical biases in the majority of cases for GPT-3.5.

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a system involving task-dependent multimedia messages on an automation-intensive production line in a modern manufacturing plant. In order to minimize the mistakes by operators while performing a small percentage of essential (but inevitable) non-automated tasks, a PC-based Intelligent Multimedia Prompt System (IMPS) was conceived. The IMPS is designed to help the operators by reminding them of the steps involved when performing specific non-automated tasks. The three main features of the IMPS are task instructions, interrupt handling and management information. Task instructions prompt the operator about the tasks to be performed. Interrupt handling caters to operations such as abrupt termination of tasks due to unforeseen circumstances. Management information provides task-related information to the supervisors. The IMPS design includes visual displays to correspond with auditory prompt messages. The IMPS was developed for handling manual intervention tasks in the production line of a local manufacturing plant. Laboratory testing and preliminary results indicate that the system is helpful in minimizing human errors.",

        "abstract": "International studies have shown the reading competence of Indonesian students to be relatively low compared to other countries. Considering the importance of reading comprehension, the current research has two aims. The first is to provide some insight into the identification of students\u2019 difficulty with reading. The second is to investigate the implementation of innovative methods for teaching reading comprehension in the Indonesian educational context. Both studies were conducted in state upper grade primary schools in Urban Sub District BCL in Bandung, Indonesia. Study One profiled students\u2019 reading performance. Five measurement instruments were developed, written in Indonesian language. The construction of mental models was also introduced. Two hundred and sixty five Grade Five students from eight schools were measured for their competence in decoding, prior knowledge, comprehension monitoring, construction of mental models, reading comprehension specifically related to a particular topic, and their general reading comprehension. The students\u2019 reading performance profiles were very varied. They showed the importance of each component for the achievement of reading comprehension. The profiles also showed the ability for each component of reading comprehension to compensate each other\u2019s function to enable the students to perform well in reading comprehension. The best-fit model for the data accounted for 47% of students\u2019 performance in reading comprehension. Study Two compared instructional interventions, and examined the way each method worked in the Indonesian educational context. The three instructional intervention methods were Reciprocal Teaching (RT), Instruction prompting students to develop Mental Models (IMM), and Instruction in Question Answering (IQA). Participants were one hundred and twelve students in the Sixth Grade from three primary schools. There were three groups in each school. Group 1 received RT followed by IMM (RT-IMM), Group 2 received IMM followed by RT (IMM-RT), and Group 3 received IQA. Group 3 was considered as the control group, since IQA is the traditional method widely adopted in Indonesia. Instruction was separated into 2 phases. Each phase consisted of four sessions of 30 minutes each over a two-week period. The implementation of IMM-RT tended to improve general reading comprehension more than other methods (RT-IMM and IQA). Interestingly, individuals who had a low performance in the pre-test for construction of mental models, improved their performance in the construction of mental models following implementation of RT at the first phase. The results support a conclusion that the IMM-RT combination is potentially effective for the enhancement of students\u2019 reading comprehension. However, further results showed that, in order to implement RT and IMM in a common state school classroom in Indonesia, the teacher\u2019s ability to manage and organise the group becomes crucial. Study Three was designed to validate the IMM-RT instructional intervention for improving performances of students with reading comprehension inadequacies, by addressing the limitations found in Study Two. Result showed that IMM-RT had potential for improving students\u2019 performance in reading comprehension. The findings of the current study provide some understanding of reading comprehension in an Indonesian educational context. Moreover, the findings will add to the repertoire of educators about issues that need to be considered in implementing innovative methods for enhancing Indonesian students\u2019 reading comprehension.",

        "abstract": "Autistic children often show lack of socially expressive skills that would allow them to engage with others more successfully and to facilitate their inclusion. Therefore, this study aims at investigating the impact of using video modeling on improving social skills for autistic children in inclusive school. Video-modeling (VM) is a widely used instructional technique that has been applied to teach children with developmental disabilities. The sample of this study consists of ten children; participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (5) and control group (5). They aged between (5-7) years. In the present study, video modeling was used to promote appropriate social skills of the experiential group. In treatment program, each child watched a videotape of two persons interacting in a play setting. One person acted as the therapist and presented the social cues. The second acted as the child, and provided models of appropriate responses. Mann-Whitne, U and Wilcoxon were used for data analysis. Results indicated that there were significant differences between the sample of this study in favor of the experimental group. Introduction Autism is a neurodevelopment disorder defined by impairments in social and communication development, accompanied by stereotyped patterns of behavior and interest (Al Zyoudi, 2008). The focus of this paper is on the early development of social skills in autism and social skills intervention for impairments in social skills associated with this disorder. Social skills deficits in children with autism include: lack of orientation towards a social stimulus and inadequate use of eye contact, problems initiating social interaction, difficulty interpreting both verbal and non-verbal social cues, inappropriate emotional response and lack of empathy to others\u2019 distress (Zriqat & Amam, 2009; Bellini & Akullian, 2007; Hine & Wolery, 2006). Several centers have developed social skill interventions to address the needs of children with autism, Among these methods are direct teaching, social reinforcement, feedback, cooperative learning, providing cues, opportunity teaching, shaping, modeling, behavioral rehearsal, peer tutoring, social stories, and video modeling (MacDonald, Sacramone, Mansfield, Wiltz & Ahern, 2009; Baker, 2007). The effective use of video modeling to help remediate the social skill deficits of children with autism is well documented. This strategy has been shown to help establish a variety of skills, including those related to play (e.g., MacDonald et al, 2009; Bellini & Akullian, 2007; D\u2019Ateno, Mangiapanello, & Taylor, 2003), self help (e.g., Shipley-Benamou, Lutzker & Taubman, 2002), academic instruction (e.g., Kinney, Vedora, & Stromer, 2006), communication (Wert & Neisworth, 2003). Video modeling is a technique that involves demonstration of desired behaviors through active video presentation of the behavior. A video modeling intervention typically involved an individual watching a video demonstration and then imitating the behavior of the model. Video modeling is a specific application of video modeling that allows the individual to imitate targeted behaviors by observing herself/himself successfully performing a behavior (Wang, Cui & Parrial, 2011; ShuklMehta, & Callahan, 2010, Bellini & Akullian, 2007). Researchers have indicated that video modeling is potentially more effective than teaching through traditional method (Reichow & Volkmar, 2010; McCoy, & Hermansen, 2007), and can improve the effectiveness of instructional prompts (Cotugno, 2009). The use of videos to teach social skills has been examined in a recently expanding body of literature. The majority of studies investigating social skills instruction via video models, however, focused on relatively simple behaviors. For example, Paterson & Arco (20070; Bidwell & Rehfeldt (2004) used video models and contingent praise to teach adults with severe disabilities to initiate an interaction by bringing a cup of coffee to an adult peer. Nikopoulos & Keenan (2007) demonstrated that video models alone were sufficient for teaching three children with autism to initiate an interaction by gesturing or vocally requesting an adult to join the child in play. A few studies investigated video-based training for more complex social skills. Using video models alone, Maione & Mirenda (2006) obtained increases in the frequency of social initiations and responses of a young boy with autism during two different play contexts. The participant watched videos of two adults engaging in appropriate verbalizations and playing with the target activities. With the implementation of video modeling, the frequency of the participant\u2019s use of both scripted and unscripted verbalizations (including initiations and responses) increased during these play sessions. However, reinforcement, video feedback, and prompting were needed to increase behavior in a third play context. The authors reported that some of the modeled statements were novel, while others already existed in the child\u2019s repertoire. Serra & Dorothea (2010) indicated that video models for teaching social skills for three children with autism increased these skills. Several authors suggest that video modeling is effective because it reduces the amount of irrelevant stimuli in the learning environment, increasing the likelihood that the participant will focus on the most relevant cues (MacDonal et al, 2009; Hine & Wolery, 2006) If so, video formats that further reduce irrelevant stimuli may help promote learning. One format that may serve to reduce additional irrelevant stimuli in the learning environment is view modeling. In this type of modeling, the camera angle is presented at the participant\u2019s eye level and shows only what the participant might see within the context of the targeted activity, skill, or context (i.e., from his or her own viewpoint). Depending on the target skill, the participant might view a specific setting or a pair of hands completing a task. Teaching with the video model may be performed in four ways: (i) modeling with video, (ii) feedback with video, (iii) cue with video, and (iv) computer-aided video teaching (Scattone, 3008; Mechling, 2005). Modeling with video is the process where the individual watches the video recordings in which all sub-steps of a skill is displayed by a peer, adult, or herself/himself/ and then repeats these behaviors (Banda, Matuszny, & Turkan, 2007). In feedback with video, the individual watches her/his own performance in a non-edited videotape; may notice her/his appropriate and inappropriate behaviors; may discuss these behaviors with the practitioner; and make adjustments in future performance (Maione, & Mirenda, 2006). Video modeling which provides individuals with the opportunity to carry out the skill step immediately on the basis of the cue given by the video and which actively involves the individual in the process is called cue with video (Mechling, 2005), implementations in which texts, graphics, animations, sound, music, slides, films and movie recordings are presented within a single system are called computer aided video training (Shukl-Mehta, & Callahan, 2010). There are a few review studies relating to the video modeling in the literature. These studies (i.e. Wang et al, 2011; Delano, 2008;McCoy, & Hermansen, 2007; Mechling, 2005) were examined according to video modeling types. The present study differs from other review studies due to some factors: First, this study analyzed video model practices used in social skills training in terms of details such as subjects, environment, research model, whether or not maintaining and generalization were targeted; in terms of fundamental categories such as social validity of the social skills selected for training; reasons for such selection; and the practice and its effectiveness. Secondly, it was based on studies conducted with individuals diagnosed with autism and other individuals with developmental disabilities. Finally, this study aimed to examine the benefits of using of video modeling intervention increasing the social skills of autistic children. The present study focused on social engagement in a natural setting. The present study also addressed a limitation of existing research by studying the effect of video modeling alone without the use of other intervention strategies. Study hypotheses: The current study aims at investigating the following hypotheses: 1. There would not be significant changes between the experimental and control groups due to the video modeling program 2. There would not be significant changes among the experimental group due to the video modeling program. 3. There would not be significant changes among the experimental group on post-test and follow up due to the video modeling program. Methods Participants Participants were 10 children diagnosed with autism by psychologist and classroom teacher. All participants were enrolled in a center-based program that provided behavioral intervention for autistic children. They were selected based on diagnosis and reports of their lack of appropriate social skills. Those children ranged in age from 5-7. They were randomly assigned to an experimental group (5) and control group (5). All sessions were conducted in a small room at the day treatment center. Study design For the purpose of this study, a pretest-post test experimental design for an experimental and control groups was used to examine the effect of using video molding on improving social skills for autistic students .

        "abstract": "We conducted a series of experiments to determine the relative contribution of unsupervised versus controlled mechanisms to the intermixed-blocked effect. In Experiment 1, participants received pre-exposure instructions prompting a search for differences between stimuli, in keeping with past studies, and the intermixed-blocked effect was observed. In the remaining experiments, participants did not receive the aforementioned instructions, but instead were instructed either to simply observe the stimuli (Experiment 2) or in relation to a masking task (Experiment 3). None of the latter experiments produced an intermixed-blocked effect, suggesting that the effect found in Experiment 1 was driven by the instructions to search for differences, consistent with a controlled processing account of the effect. Moreover, we tested a prediction assuming the operation of a search strategy against one assuming the operation of a short-term habituation mechanism and found evidence more consistent with the search strategy hypothesis. We formulate a new account of the intermixed-blocked effect in humans based on an instruction-driven search and discuss how the account could explain many findings in the human literature.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic forced universities to suspend face-to-face instruction, prompting a rapid transition to online education. As many lab courses transitioned online, this provided a rare window of opportunity to learn about the challenges and affordances that the online lab experiences created for students and instructors. We present results from exploratory educational research that investigated student motivation and self-regulated learning in the online lab environment. We consider two student factors: motivation and self-regulation. The instrument is administered to students (n = 121) at the beginning of the semester and statistically analysed for comparisons between different demographic groups. The results indicated students' major was the only distinguishing factor for their motivation and self-regulation. Students' unfamiliarity with online labs or uncertainty about what to expect in the course contributed to the lower levels of self-regulation. The lack of significant differences between various subgroups was not surprising, as we posit many students entered the virtual lab environment with the same level of online lab experience. We conducted interviews among these respondents to explore the factors in greater detail. Using latent Dirichlet allocation, three main topics that emerged: (1) Learning Compatibility, (2) Questions and Inquiry, and (3) Planning and Coordination.",

        "abstract": "Even though the 2014 Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act strengthens federal and state commitments to employing people with disabilities, there remain millions of Americans with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities (ID) who are still unemployed. To succeed in competitive employment, workers with ID require help with memory, task sequence and planning, and time management; skills that are often referred to as executive functioning. Typically, employers do not have the training to manage people with ID with these challenges. This task falls to job coaches, job developers or employment specialists (e.g., providers) and the agencies that provide such services. Without effective and efficient tools to support the executive functioning of individuals with ID, policies that aim to affect their competitive integrated employment can result in an unmanageable burden on the provider. Today\u2019s jobs are more complex. Providers need tools that can help them effectively and efficiently build, record and adjust prompts and instructions as changes occur in real-time. However, they may not have the time and/or the skills required to make clear, accurate instructional prompts for multiple workers with ID in different settings. To identify the needs of employers, providers, and workers with ID, a NIDILRR-funded project collected data from supervisors, employers and providers of employment services to workers with ID. These interviews were used to determine the requirements of an ideal system that would help them better instruct, coach, track progress and manage teams of employees with ID. This brief describes their findings and development of a cloud-based interactive electronic job coaching app that allows emplyment services providers to efficiently convert work assignments into the essential details required by the mobile worker with ID, and then wirelessly transfer the appropriate instructions to the worker\u2019s electronic coach.",

        "abstract": "Research has shown that providing instructional prompts in computer-based learning environments designed to support example-based learning fosters learning. In computer-based environments, where learners interact only with a computer and do not have access to direct support from a teacher, learners need to be provided with instructional prompts or just-in-time help intended to encourage more active example processing during learning. This study investigated whether it was more beneficial to provide the learners access to on-demand (self-regulated) help after they committed an error in problem solving or for the learning environment to regulate the presentation of instructional help externally. Furthermore, two different presentational formats-textual and pictorial-of instructional prompts were examined. This study was conducted with a computer-based learning environment that introduced high school students without any prior content-specific knowledge to the principles of parallel and series circuit analysis. Textual prompts facilitated practice problem solving notably better than pictorial prompts. Overall, textual-based prompts produced a large effect on near transfer. A significant format of prompts by academic ability interaction was discovered on near transfer. In particular, lower-ability learners scored significantly better when given textual prompts; whereas, their higher-ability counterparts performed equally well with both formats. Moreover, learners provided with externally regulated prompts reported significantly more positive attitudes toward the prompts in general compared to learners in the self-regulated conditions. Finally, continuous motivation was significantly stronger in learners who viewed textual prompts than in their counterparts in the pictorial prompt groups.",

        "abstract": "Single-task models have proven pivotal in solving specific tasks; however, they have limitations in real-world applications where multi-tasking is necessary and domain shifts are exhibited. Recently, instructional prompts have shown significant improvement towards multi-task generalization; however, the effect of instructional prompts and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has not been systematically studied in the biomedical domain. Motivated by this, this paper explores the impact of instructional prompts for biomedical MTL. We introduce the BoX, a collection of 32 instruction tasks for Biomedical NLP across (X) various categories. Using this meta-dataset, we propose a unified model termed In-BoXBART, that can jointly learn all tasks of the BoX without any task-specific modules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a unified model in the biomedical domain and use instructions to achieve generalization across several biomedical tasks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model: 1) outperforms the single-task baseline by ~3% and multi-task (without instruction) baseline by ~18% on an average, and 2) shows ~23% improvement compared to the single-task baseline in few-shot learning (i.e., 32 instances per task) on an average. Our analysis indicates that there is significant room for improvement across tasks in the BoX, implying the scope for future research direction.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of a dog would have an impact on object recognition memory performance of preschool children. This work represents an extension of previous research which found that preschoolers require fewer instructional prompts to complete this type of memory task when in the presence of a dog. If children require fewer instructional prompts it is possible that they are better able to focus on the task itself and as a result, improved memory performance is likely. Because the earlier experiment utilized a very simple version of the task that was readily completed by the preschool children, the overall performance data were at ceiling. The current study, involving 20 preschool children, included a manipulation of task difficulty through varying the number of distracters (one versus four) present at test. Increasing the number of distractors in a simple recognition task is known to make that task more challenging, and thus performance was expected to be slower and less accurate in the four distracter conditions relative to the one-distracter conditions. The collaborators in the study were either a therapy dog or a human. A two-way repeated measures design was used such that each child served as his/her own control and was tested in each of four separate conditions: dog present (one and four distracters) and human present (one and four distracters). The results showed that the preschool children performed the object recognition task faster and more accurately in the presence of the therapy dog relative to a human and also in the one-distracter versus four-distracter condition. The authors conclude that these effects result from increased focus and/or motivation resulting from the presence of the dog.",

        "abstract": ": Designing problems and learning activities is a key factor to initiating students \u2019 engagement with the course material and influencing their reasoning processes. Although tasks and problems are a central part of teaching and assessments in the chemistry classroom, they may not engage students in deep reasoning or in a way that is intended through a task. Some problems may cause an algorithmic or a surface approach. Even with designing clever problems, students may not use a larger variety of chemistry ideas and connect them in meaningful ways. Here the idea of scaffolding students \u2019 answering process comes into play. Structuring students \u2019 reasoning process through instructional prompts or structured worksheets supports students in activating and connecting knowledge pieces in a more meaningful way and positively slows down their fast decision-making process.This paper will discussthe importance of asking questions in chemistry teaching and highlights the idea of contrasting cases, drawn from cognitive psychology, as a task design principle. In addition to having contrasting cases as a good problem format, the idea of scaffolding students \u2019 reasoning while solving contrasting cases through the use of instructional prompts that scaffold the reasoning process will be exemplarily showcased for mechanistic reasoning in organic chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Using Piaget\u2019s perspective of individual cognition and Vygotsky\u2019s theory of social constructivism as lenses, this paper reports on the instructional prompts that are used by biology lecturers to promote student interaction. The study further reports on the link between the prompts used and the subsequent quality of the interaction. Three lecturers were observed teaching third- and fourth-year pre-service teachers at a university. The first author used an observation schedule to describe what was observed in detail. Observational data and vignettes were coded for instructional prompts, and the codes were categorised subsequently. This study found that lecturers used a variety of formats of instructional prompts including the use of teaching and learning aids, teaching strategies, teaching procedures and teaching and learning activities to foster interaction. The study also found that, while the quality of the interaction could be dependent on the use of a particular type of instructional prompt (like the novel stories used in this study), it was also dependent on how the lecturer facilitated the interaction. An interesting finding that came out of this study is that allowing for cognitive interaction before social interaction enhanced the quality of student interaction in terms of engagement for learning. The study recommends that lecturers should allow students to first interact cognitively (using tools such as a worksheet) to allow for restructuring of their thinking that would then be showcased in the social interaction.",
