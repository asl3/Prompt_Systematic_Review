        "abstract": "Energy load forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing resource allocation and managing energy consumption in buildings and cities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages language models for energy load forecasting. We employ prompting techniques to convert energy consumption data into descriptive sentences, enabling fine-tuning of language models. By adopting an autoregressive generating approach, our proposed method enables predictions of various horizons of future energy load consumption. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed method. Our results indicate that utilizing language models for energy load forecasting holds promise for enhancing energy efficiency and facilitating intelligent decision-making in energy systems.",

In addition, comprehension was tested after subjects completed the tracking task. Two experiments were conducted with normally hearing subjects, one in which subjects tracked in an auditory plus noise condition and the second in which they tracked in a visual-alone condition. The results of these two experiments showed significant differences between tracking rates for controlled versus uncontrolled materials for both modalities, with higher tracking rates observed for the controlled materials. The use of specific prompting techniques reduced intertester variability in both modalities. Further, results indicated that comprehension ability and tracking skill are not perfectly related.",

        "abstract": "The traditional Dialogue State Tracking (DST) problem aims to track user preferences and intents in user-agent conversations. While sufficient for task-oriented dialogue systems supporting narrow domain applications, the advent of Large Language Model (LLM)-based chat systems has introduced many real-world intricacies in open-domain dialogues. These intricacies manifest in the form of increased complexity in contextual interactions, extended dialogue sessions encompassing a diverse array of topics, and more frequent contextual shifts. To handle these intricacies arising from evolving LLM-based chat systems, we propose joint dialogue segmentation and state tracking per segment in open-domain dialogue systems. Assuming a zero-shot setting appropriate to a true open-domain dialogue system, we propose S3-DST, a structured prompting technique that harnesses Pre-Analytical Recollection, a novel grounding mechanism we designed for improving long context tracking. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in joint segmentation and state tracking, we evaluate S3-DST on a proprietary anonymized open-domain dialogue dataset, as well as publicly available DST and segmentation datasets. Across all datasets and settings, S3-DST consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating its potency and robustness the next generation of LLM-based chat systems.",

        "abstract": "Language models are achieving impressive performance on various tasks by aggressively adopting inference-time prompting techniques, such as zero-shot and few-shot prompting. In this work, we introduce EchoPrompt, a simple yet effective approach that prompts the model to rephrase its queries before answering them. EchoPrompt is adapted for both zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning with standard and chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results show that EchoPrompt yields substantial improvements across all these settings for four families of causal language models. These improvements are observed across various numerical reasoning (e.g. GSM8K, SVAMP), reading comprehension (e.g. DROP), and logical reasoning (e.g. Coin Flipping) tasks. On average, EchoPrompt improves the Zero-shot-CoT performance of code-davinci-002 by 5% in numerical tasks and 13% in reading comprehension tasks. We investigate the factors contributing to EchoPrompt's effectiveness through ablation studies, which reveal that both the original query and the model-generated rephrased version are instrumental in its performance gains. Our empirical results indicate that EchoPrompt is an effective technique that enhances in-context learning performance. We recommend incorporating EchoPrompt into various baseline prompting strategies to achieve performance boosts.",

However, despite proving competitive on most tasks in the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks, existing prompt-based techniques fail on the semantic distinction task of the Word-in-Context (WiC) dataset. Specifically, none of the existing few-shot approaches (including the in-context learning of GPT-3) can attain a performance that is meaningfully different from the random baseline.Trying to fill this gap, we propose a new prompting technique, based on similarity metrics, which boosts few-shot performance to the level of fully supervised methods. Our simple adaptation shows that the failure of existing prompt-based techniques in semantic distinction is due to their improper configuration, rather than lack of relevant knowledge in the representations. We also show that this approach can be effectively extended to other downstream tasks for which a single prompt is sufficient.",

This study employed the experimental method with a pre-experimental design. The subjects of this study were English learners age 16 to 19 in Palopo City who were chosen using a purposive sampling technique to select the active learners. Using the oral presentation task, the writers compiled three aspects of the learner's score, i.e. accuracy, fluency, and comprehensibility. The experimental teaching was conducted in six meetings, preceded by a pre-test and ended by a post-test. The pre-test found that the learners\u2019 speaking skill ability is low (mean score: 25.75). In post-test, the authors found that the learners\u2019 language ability substantially improved.

Prompting technologies have gained popularity over the last decade and have the potential to assist these individuals with IADLs in order to live independently. Although prompting techniques are routinely used by caregivers and health care providers to aid individuals with cognitive impairment in maintaining their independence with everyday activities, there is no clear consensus or gold standard regarding prompt content, method of instruction, timing of delivery, or interface of prompt delivery in the gerontology or technology literatures. In this paper, we demonstrate how cognitive rehabilitation principles can inform and advance the development of more effective assistive prompting technologies that could be employed in smart environments. We first describe cognitive rehabilitation theory (CRT) and show how it provides a useful theoretical foundation for guiding the development of assistive technologies for IADL completion. We then use the CRT framework to critically review existing smart prompting technologies to answer questions that will be integral to advancing development of effective smart prompting technologies.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Evidence-based strategies for play, such as the application of systematic prompting techniques, require education and collaboration between occupational therapists and classroom educators to support implementation and carryover. Educating teachers and paraprofessionals regarding systematic prompting strategies to increase play within the classroom can work toward decreasing the play deficits experienced by students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). This pilot project investigated the immediate effects of a virtual workshop series for preschool educators on knowledge and self-efficacy of systematic prompting strategies for play. The virtual platform was implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to follow health and safety protocols. Using a pretest posttest design, participants from an inclusive preschool were recruited to participate in a virtual workshop series. We found that participants demonstrated a positive and statistically significant change in both knowledge and self-efficacy. Participants were highly satisfied with the content and delivery of the workshops, however additional hands-on training to solidify their understanding was noted as an area of need. This pilot project provides a model for creation of virtual workshops, the sharing of resources as well as the value of interprofessional collaboration.",

        "abstract": "In an era marked by the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for various tasks, there is a growing focus on exploring LLMs' capabilities in handling web data, particularly graph data. Dynamic graphs, which capture temporal network evolution patterns, are ubiquitous in real-world web data. Evaluating LLMs' competence in understanding spatial-temporal information on dynamic graphs is essential for their adoption in web applications, which remains unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we bridge the gap via proposing to evaluate LLMs' spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time. Specifically, we propose the LLM4DyG benchmark, which includes nine specially designed tasks considering the capability evaluation of LLMs from both temporal and spatial dimensions. Then, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different data generators, data statistics, prompting techniques, and LLMs on the model performance. Finally, we propose Disentangled Spatial-Temporal Thoughts (DST2) for LLMs on dynamic graphs to enhance LLMs' spatial-temporal understanding abilities. Our main observations are: 1) LLMs have preliminary spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs, 2) Dynamic graph tasks show increasing difficulties for LLMs as the graph size and density increase, while not sensitive to the time span and data generation mechanism, 3) the proposed DST2 prompting method can help to improve LLMs' spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs for most tasks. The data and codes will be open-sourced at publication time.",

Method: A single-subject multiple baseline design across participants (n\u2009=\u20093) was used to assess the effects of VM intervention on requesting behaviour. Intervention consisted of having each participant view a VM of two adults demonstrating the requesting of a preferred object using the SGD. Additionally, a least-to-most-prompting technique was employed to facilitate the production of a correct response. Results: All three participants demonstrated the ability to request preferred objects following the intervention and were able to generalize the newly acquired requesting behaviour across stimuli and people. Conclusions: Study findings indicate that a VM treatment package is effective in facilitating communication in children with little or no functional speech.",

        "abstract": "The realm of computer vision has witnessed a paradigm shift with the advent of foundational models, mirroring the transformative influence of large language models in the domain of natural language processing. This paper delves into the exploration of open-world segmentation, presenting a novel approach called Image Prompt Segmentation (IPSeg) that harnesses the power of vision foundational models. At the heart of IPSeg lies the principle of a training-free paradigm, which capitalizes on image prompting techniques. IPSeg utilizes a single image containing a subjective visual concept as a flexible prompt to query vision foundation models like DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion. Our approach extracts robust features for the prompt image and input image, then matches the input representations to the prompt representations via a novel feature interaction module to generate point prompts highlighting target objects in the input image. The generated point prompts are further utilized to guide the Segment Anything Model to segment the target object in the input image. The proposed method stands out by eliminating the need for exhaustive training sessions, thereby offering a more efficient and scalable solution. Experiments on COCO, PASCAL VOC, and other datasets demonstrate IPSeg's efficacy for flexible open-world segmentation using intuitive image prompts. This work pioneers tapping foundation models for open-world understanding through visual concepts conveyed in images.",

While LLMs are often impressive in performance, their efficacy in real-world scenarios that demand expert knowledge remains unclear. LLMs are believed to hold the most potential and value in education, especially in the development of Artificial intelligence (AI) based virtual teachers capable of facilitating language learning. Our focus is centered on evaluating the efficacy of LLMs in the realm of education, specifically in the areas of spoken language learning which encompass phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition. We introduce a new multiple-choice question dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in the aforementioned scenarios, including understanding and application of spoken language knowledge. In addition, we investigate the influence of various prompting techniques such as zero- and few-shot method (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars), chain-of-thought (CoT, think step-by-step), in-domain exampler and external tools (Google, Wikipedia). We conducted large-scale evaluation on popular LLMs (20 distinct models) using these methods. We achieved significant performance improvements compared to the zero-shot baseline in the practical questions reasoning (GPT-3.5, 49.1% ->63.1%; LLaMA2-70B-Chat, 42.2% ->48.6%). We found that models of different sizes have good understanding of concepts in phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition, but show limitations in reasoning for real-world problems. Additionally, we also explore preliminary findings on conversational communication.",

        "abstract": "A flurry of recent work has demonstrated that pre-trained large language models (LLMs) can be effective task planners for a variety of single-robot tasks. The planning performance of LLMs is significantly improved via prompting techniques, such as in-context learning or re-prompting with state feedback, placing new importance on the token budget for the context window. An under-explored but natural next direction is to investigate LLMs as multi-robot task planners. However, long-horizon, heterogeneous multi-robot planning introduces new challenges of coordination while also pushing up against the limits of context window length. It is therefore critical to find token-efficient LLM planning frameworks that are also able to reason about the complexities of multi-robot coordination. In this work, we compare the task success rate and token efficiency of four multi-agent communication frameworks (centralized, decentralized, and two hybrid) as applied to four coordination-dependent multi-agent 2D task scenarios for increasing numbers of agents. We find that a hybrid framework achieves better task success rates across all four tasks and scales better to more agents. We further demonstrate the hybrid frameworks in 3D simulations where the vision-to-text problem and dynamical errors are considered.

        "abstract": "It is well known that some survey respondents reduce the effort they invest in answering questions by taking mental shortcuts - survey satisficing. This is a concern because such shortcuts can reduce the quality of responses and, potentially, the accuracy of survey estimates. This article explores \"speeding,\" an extreme type of satisficing, which we define as answering so quickly that respondents could not have given much, if any, thought to their answers. To reduce speeding among online respondents we implemented an interactive prompting technique. When respondents answered faster than a minimal response time threshold, they received a message encouraging them to answer carefully and take their time. Across six web survey experiments, this prompting technique reduced speeding on subsequent questions compared to a no prompt control. Prompting slowed response times whether the speeding that triggered the prompt occurred early or late in the questionnaire, in the first or later waves of a longitudinal survey, among respondents recruited from non-probability or probability panels, or whether the prompt was delivered on only the first or on all speeding episodes. In addition to reducing speeding, the prompts increased response accuracy on simple arithmetic questions for a key subgroup. Prompting also reduced later straightlining in one experiment, suggesting the benefits may generalize to other types of mental shortcuts. Although the prompting could have annoyed respondents, it was not accompanied by a noticeable increase in breakoffs. As an alternative technique, respondents in one experiment were asked to explicitly commit to responding carefully. This global approach complemented the more local, interactive prompting technique on several measures. Taken together, these results suggest that interactive interventions of this sort may be useful for increasing respondents' conscientiousness in online questionnaires, even though these questionnaires are self-administered.",

However, the type of instruments by energy sources and technique used vary among each institution. We reviewed the literature to seek the best technique for parenchymal transection, which was proposed as one of the important clinical question in the 2nd International Consensus Conference on LLR held on October 2014. While publications have described transection techniques used in LLR from 1991 to June 2014, it is difficult to specify the best technique and device for laparoscopic hepatic parenchymal transection, owing to a lack of randomized trials with only a small number of comparative studies. However, it is clear that instruments should be used in combination with others based on their functions and the depth of liver resection. Most authors have reported using staplers to secure and divide major vessels. Preparation for prevention of unexpected hemorrhaging particularly in liver cirrhosis, the Pringle's maneuver and prompt technique for hemostasis should be performed.

The specific assignment prompted students to define and explain their career goals as engineers. Using text embedding representations of student responses, we clustered the responses together to identify thematically similar statements from students. The clustered responses were then summarized to quickly identify career interest themes. We also used a set of a priori codes about career satisfaction and sectors to demonstrate an alternative approach to using these generative text models to analyze student writing. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of NLP techniques in engineering education research. By automating the initial analysis of student essays, researchers and educators can more efficiently and accurately identify key themes and patterns in student writing. The methods presented in this paper have broader applications for engineering education and research purposes beyond analyzing student essays.

Chatbots, serving as interactive conversational models, will probably drive this patient-centered transformation in healthcare. Through the provision of various services, including diagnosis, personalized lifestyle recommendations, and mental health support, the objective is to substantially augment patient health outcomes, all the while mitigating the workload burden on healthcare providers. The life-critical nature of healthcare applications necessitates establishing a unified and comprehensive set of evaluation metrics for conversational models. Existing evaluation metrics proposed for various generic large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a lack of comprehension regarding medical and health concepts and their significance in promoting patients' well-being. Moreover, these metrics neglect pivotal user-centered aspects, including trust-building, ethics, personalization, empathy, user comprehension, and emotional support. The purpose of this paper is to explore state-of-the-art LLM-based evaluation metrics that are specifically applicable to the assessment of interactive conversational models in healthcare.

DTIC has two gateways: Defense Gateway Information System (DGIS) and Search Menu-Aided Easy Searching Through Relevant Options (Search MAESTRO). NLM also has two: Micro-Chemical Substances Information Network (Micro-CSIN) and Grateful MED. Each has strengths and weaknesses; DTIC and NLM experience with them, along with commercial and academic developments, reveal opportunities for improvements. We recommend that: (1) DTIC enhance DGIS to enable all users structure search strategies and select suitable databases, and adapt DGIS so that search terms used for one database can be used in several. Such improvements should enable DTIC to use DGIS to meet all user needs; (2) NLM improve the user-friendliness of Micro-CSIN with online and window prompting techniques and modify Micro-CSIN to incorporate controlled vocabulary terms and names into a search strategy. NLM should decide how to incorporate Micro-CSIN and Grateful MED into ABIDE; (3) DTIC and NLM adopt developments from the commercial and academic sectors such as an object-oriented gateway environment, develop expert systems to aid in creating more effective search strategies, and consider cooperative funding arrangements for future gateway development.",

Berdasarkan hasil observasi, peneliti menemukan permasalahan yaitu peserta didik kurang memiliki kemampuan berpikir kritis dalam pembelajaran IPS. Hal ini ditunjukan dengan beberapa indikator permasalahan diantaranya kurang aktifnya peserta didik saat pembelajaran di kelas. Ketika siswa bertanya, pertanyaan yang diajukan hanya sebatas pada tataran ingatan, siswa juga belum mampu menjawab pertanyaan dari guru menggunakan analisisnya sendiri, mereka hanya terpaku kepada buku teks. Alternatif pemecahan masalah yang menjadi pilihan peneliti yaitu dengan menerapkan metode tanya jawab dengan teknik probing-prompting, dimana guru memberikan serangkaian pertanyaan untuk membangkitkan kemampuan berpikir kritis siswa. Meninjau permasalahan yang akan diteliti berkaitan dengan proses pembelajaran, maka peneliti memilih Penelitian Tindakan Kelas (PTK) dengan model Kemmis Mc. Taggart yang dilakukan dalam 4 siklus. Peningkatan keterampilan berpikir kritis peserta didik di kelas VIII-4 SMP Negeri 1 Bandung melalui metode tanya jawab dengan teknik probing-prompting dapat dikatakan berhasil. Berhasilnya penelitian ini dilihat dari adanya peningkatan kuantitas dan kualitas keterampilan berpikir kritis peserta didik yang ditunjukkan melalui perkembangan aspek-aspek atau beberapa indikator keterampilan berpikir kritis. Berdasarkan data hasil penelitian, seluruh aspek dari keterampilan berpikir kritis yang dikembangkan mengalami peningkatan dari siklus pertama hingga siklus keempat. Dari kualitas cukup, baik, hingga sangat baik. Indikator keterampilan berpikir kritis yang masuk ke dalam kategori sangat baik adalah indikator merumuskan pertanyaan, aktif dalam menjawab pertanyaan dari guru, menjawab pertanyaan dengan menggunakan kalimat sendiri, jawaban yang diberikan diperkuat dengan argumen yang jelas, dan kalimat yang digunakan dapat di mengerti. Kesimpulannya bahwa metode tanya jawab dengan teknik probing-prompting dapat meningkatkan keterampilan berpikir kritis siswa. ---------- This research is motivated by the problems the researcher founf at the time of preliminary observations in class VIII-4 SMP Negeri 1 Bandung. Based on the observations, the researcher found problems that the students lack the critical thinking skills in social studies subject (IPS). This is proven by several indicators of problems including the inactivity of learners when learning in the classroom. When students ask questions merely at the level of memory, students are also not able to answer questions from the teacher using their own analysis, they simply followed the textbook. Alternative solutions of the problem chosen by the researcher is to apply the method of question and answer with the probing-prompting technique, where the teacher gives a series of questions to arouse students' critical thinking skills. Reviewing the problems to be studied with regard to the learning process, the researcher chose a Class Action Research (PTK) with Kemmis Mc Taggart models done in four cycles. Improving the critical thinking skills of students in class VIII-4 SMP Negeri 1 Bandung through the question and answer method by prompting probing- technique was successful. The accomplishment of this study can be seen from the quantity and quality improvements of students\u2019 critical thinking skill which is shown through the development of the aspects or several indicators of critical thinking skills. Based on the research findings, all aspects of developed critical thinking skills encounter the improvement from the first cycle to the fourth cycle, from the quality of fair, good, to excellent. Critical thinking skill indicators in the excellent category are the indicators of formulating the questions, being active in answering teacher\u2019s questions, answering the questions by using their own words, giving the answers which are reinforced by the clear arguments and using the understandable sentences. Therefore, it can be concluded that using the question-answer session method through probing-prompting technique can improve students\u2019 critical thinking skill.",

In learning, critical thinking skills have been applied in learning environments to address student challenges in the 21st century. This study aims to explore students' critical thinking skills during the learning process using the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) model assisted by the probing prompting technique. The method used in this study was a literature review, by analyzing and synthesizing several Physics education journals published in 2017-2022 which discussed critical thinking skills, Problem-Based Learning (PBL) models, and probing prompting techniques with the research sample being students at elaboration of junior, high school, and college students who have different levels of understanding. Based on the results of the 40 journals in this study, it was found that the PBL model assisted by the probing prompting technique is an innovative learning model that can be applied in active learning to improve critical thinking skills, which is one of the dimensions in the Pancasila student profile. This is because this model displays various problems that occur in everyday life, through a series of questions as a guide so that it can stimulate students to seek and find solutions to a problem. The results of this study can be used as recommendations for teachers in classroom learning activities to improve students\u2019 critical thinking skills.",

The present study investigated whether language-derived emotion-concept knowledge would causally support emotion inference by manipulating the language-specific knowledge representations in large language models. Using the prompt technique, 14 attributes of emotion concepts were found to be represented by distinct artificial neuron populations. By manipulating these attribute-related neurons, the majority of the emotion inference tasks showed performance deterioration compared to random manipulations. The attribute-specific performance deterioration was related to the importance of different attributes in human mental space. Our findings provide causal evidence in support of a language-based mechanism for emotion inference and highlight the contributions of emotion-concept knowledge.",

For each mail-out, the sample was divided into experimental (received prompt) and comparison (no prompt) groups, and one type of prompt or combination was used. Non-returnees of the questionnaire in the experimental group received either: (a) a single telephone call, (b) a memo, (c) a package (personal letter and new questionnaire) or package plus a telephone call, or (d) a double call. Comparison physicians and clergy were mailed only the original questionnaire. Relative to their respective comparison group's return rate, which averaged 22% across the four mail-outs (range 18% to 24%), the single call and package alone about doubled the overall return rate, the package and call increased the return rate about two-and-a-half fold, and the double call almost tripled the return rate. The memo was ineffective. A cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that the double-call procedure was less expensive than the single call, and much less expensive than the package alone or package with a call in securing returns. An analysis of the pattern of returns showed clearly that when prompts were not delivered (comparison groups), very few returns were received after about seven days from the initial mail-out. Most returns from prompts (experimental groups) were received by several days after the prompt. The results were seen as salient to the problem of reducing selection or volunteer bias in questionnaire studies and subsequent research demonstrating the effectiveness of telephone calls made about a week after distribution of surveys in securing high return rates was discussed.",

Although it exhibits impressive performance predominantly on natural images, understanding its robustness against various image perturbations and domains is critical for real-world applications where such challenges frequently arise. In this study we conduct a comprehensive robustness investigation of SAM under diverse real-world conditions. Our experiments encompass a wide range of image perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAM's performance generally declines under perturbed images, with varying degrees of vulnerability across different perturbations. By customizing prompting techniques and leveraging domain knowledge based on the unique characteristics of each dataset, the model's resilience to these perturbations can be enhanced, addressing dataset-specific challenges. This work sheds light on the limitations and strengths of SAM in real-world applications, promoting the development of more robust and versatile image segmentation solutions.",

        "abstract": "Two instructional prompting procedures, progressive time delay and the system of least prompts, were compared to ascertain which was more effective and efficient in teaching expressive manual signs to three adolescent students with multiple handicaps; two students had moderate retardation and one had severe retardation. The procedures were evaluated using a parallel treatments design. Results indicate that both the system of least prompts and progressive time delay procedures were effective in teaching each student eight manual signs of environmental objects. All targeted signs were taught to criterion and maintained throughout the study. However, when comparing the efficiency of the two procedures, data indicate that the time delay procedure was more efficient relative to the rate of acquisition (trials and sessions to criterion), errors to criterion, and direct instructional time. When planning instructional programs for students with handicaps, teachers must con sider both the effectiveness and efficiency of instructional procedures. Efficiency factors such as rate of acquisition, errors to criterion, time spent in direct instruction, and mainte nance of learned behaviors are all important factors when selecting an instructional pro cedure. Some instructional strategies are con sidered response prompting techniques (Wol ery & Gast, 1984). These techniques enable teachers to manipulate students' responses, thus increasing the probability that they will emit the targeted behaviors in the presence of instructional stimuli. Commonly used re sponse prompting procedures are the most to-least intrusive prompt (Csapo, 1981), the least-to-most intrusive prompt (system of least prompts) (Alberto & Schofield, 1979), and the time delay procedure (Snell & Gast, 1981). The present study addresses two response prompting procedures: time delay and system of least prompts. Time delay has been used effectively to teach a variety of tasks to stu dents with mental retardation and related de velopmental disabilities. Among others, these include instruction-following (Striefel, Bryan, & Aikens, 1974; Striefel, Wetherby, & Karlan, 1976), manual sign reading (Smeets & Striefel, 1 The authors are grateful for the assistance pro vided by Stephanie Godby and Don Cross, Ed.D, Chairperson, Department of Special Education, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky. 1976), manual sign production (Browder, Morris, & Snell, 1981; Kleinen & Gast, 1982), picture naming (Gast, Kirk, Schuster, & Wol ery, 1985), sight-word reading (Browder, Hines, McCarthy, & Fees, 1984; McGee & McCoy, 1981), requesting food items (Char lop, Schreibman, & Thibodeau, 1985), bed making (Snell, 1982), task assembly (Walls, Haught, & Dowler, 1982), and visual discrim ination tasks (Touchette & Howard, 1984). The system of least prompts procedure has been used effectively to teach a variety of self help skills and daily living skills including toothbrushing (Horner & Keilitz, 1975), put ting on one's own hearing aid (Tucker & Berry, 1980), mending clothing (Cronin & Cuvo, 1979), and laundry skills (Cuvo, Leaf, & Borakove, 1978). Cooperative leisure skills were also successfully taught using the system of least prompts (Nietupski & Svoboda, 1982). Kohl, Wilcox, and Karlan (1978) used a mod ification of both the system of least prompts and time delay fading procedures to teach manual signs to moderately handicapped stu dents. Although research has demonstrated that these procedures are effective in teaching a variety of skills, Billingsley and Romer (1983) report that \"it is surprising that systematic comparisons of those procedures, and explo rations of variations within methods, are ex tremely rare in the literature\" (p. 6).

        "abstract": "Research has demonstrated that children with specific language impairment (SLI) have difficulties producing oral narratives, particularly features of macrostructural and microstructural organization. In addition, numerous methods of eliciting oral narratives (e.g. visual images and conversation techniques) have been used, with little agreement as to which is the most effective in eliciting optimal narratives in children with and without SLI. The aim of the current study was to investigate the oral narrative skills of children with SLI, focusing on their ability to generate and use elements related to macrostructural and microstructural organization when presented with visual vs. verbal methods of oral narrative elicitation. Eight participants with SLI (mean age 7;7) were recruited from a mainstream school with an attached language unit in the North West of England. The participants produced oral narratives elicited using a wordless picture book and a conversation prompt technique. An examination of the results and raw data suggested that the conversation prompts (verbal method) were more effective at recognizing the oral narrative abilities of children with SLI.

        "abstract": "Inspired by DETR variants, query-based end-to-end instance segmentation (QEIS) methods have recently outperformed CNN-based models on large-scale datasets. Yet they would lose efficacy when only a small amount of training data is available since it's hard for the crucial queries/kernels to learn localization and shape priors. To this end, this work offers a novel unsupervised pre-training solution for low-data regimes. Inspired by the recent success of the Prompting technique, we introduce a new pre-training method that boosts QEIS models by giving Saliency Prompt for queries/kernels. Our method contains three parts: 1) Saliency Masks Proposal is responsible for generating pseudo masks from unlabeled images based on the saliency mechanism. 2) Prompt-Kernel Matching transfers pseudo masks into prompts and injects the corresponding localization and shape priors to the best-matched kernels. 3) Kernel Supervision is applied to supply supervision at the kernel level for robust learning. From a practical perspective, our pre-training method helps QEIS models achieve a similar convergence speed and comparable performance with CNN-based models in low-data regimes. Experimental results show that our method significantly boosts several QEIS models on three datasets.11Code: https://github.com/lifuguan/saliency.prompt",

        "abstract": "Like no other organised activity, primary and secondary education brings together people of different gender, social status, ability, and personality. Differentiating considerations of the persons in the school system are required to take account of the enormous heterogeneity of individual profiles. Different groups of students with different requirements call for differentiated analyses in order to meet their individual needs. For example, students with learning or behavioural deficits need different support than regular or average-ability students, who in turn may be differently treated than physically or mentally gifted students. Gender differences should be considered as well as differences in the status or age of persons. In this issue of primary and secondary education, the differentiating element of research becomes particularly clear. Different groups of students with different abilities and goals are examined by means of differentiated research methods. It becomes obvious that no research approach is the same as another, that no research method duplicates another. Each research activity is tailored to the specific needs of the student groups under investigation. In this way, the methodological diversity reflects a heterogeneity that is unquestionably present at school, with the aim of providing research findings, conclusions, and recommendations tailored to specific groups or recipients. All the contributions collected here realise this worthwhile goal in the most excellent way. The seven articles presented can be divided into two groups, the first five focusing on primary education and the last two on secondary education. The article by Paananen, Aro, N\u20acahri, and Aro (2018) presents a group-based training program for primary school students with attention and executive function deficits. Depending on the severity of the disorder, attention, executive functions, and academic skills improved over the course of half a year in comparison to a control group. The study by Acar, Evans, Rudasill, and Yildiz (2018) draws attention to the development of antisocial behaviour in young elementary school children. The authors show that teacher\u2013child relationship quality moderates the relation between parent\u2013child conflict and children\u2019s antisocial behaviour. When teachers manage to build a close relationship with the student, antisocial behaviour is reduced. The paper by Vogelaar and Resing (2018) points out that dynamic testing can favour analogy-problem solving. The graduating prompting techniques built into the training program helped gifted as well as average-ability children but did not provide any advantage for processing a transfer task. H\u20acanze, M\u20ac uller, and Berger (2018) realised with their study the idea of a modified tutor training, which puts more emphasis on knowledge-building than on knowledge-testing. Third-grade primary students who were instructed by trained tutors reported more self-determined behaviour and learned more than same-aged tutees of untrained tutors. Vendeville, Blanc, and Brechet (2018) dealt with the question of how primary school children process reported emotions in stories. After hearing stories, elementary school children were asked to draw emotions into the contours of the main characters. The authors found notable differences between boys and girls in the portrayal of sadness and anger.",

SciGraphQA is 13 times larger than ChartVQA, the previously largest chart-visual question-answering dataset. It is also the largest open-sourced chart VQA dataset with non-synthetic charts. To build our dataset, we selected 290,000 Computer Science or Machine Learning ArXiv papers published between 2010 and 2020, and then used Palm-2 to generate 295K samples of open-vocabulary multi-turn question-answering dialogues about the graphs. As context, we provided the text-only Palm-2 with paper title, abstract, paragraph mentioning the graph, and rich text contextual data from the graph itself, obtaining dialogues with an average 2.23 question-answer turns for each graph. We asked GPT-4 to assess the matching quality of our question-answer turns given the paper's context, obtaining an average rating of 8.7/10 on our 3K test set. We evaluated the 0-shot capability of the most popular MLLM models such as LLaVa, mPLUGowl, BLIP-2, and openFlamingo's on our dataset, finding LLaVA-13B being the most performant with a CIDEr score of 0.08. We further enriched the question prompts for LLAVA by including the serialized data tables extracted from the graphs using the DePlot model, boosting LLaVA's 0-shot CIDEr to 0.15. To verify the validity of our dataset, we also fine-tuned LLaVa using our dataset, reaching a substantially higher CIDEr score of 0.26. We anticipate further accuracy improvement by including segmentation mask tokens and leveraging larger LLM backbones coupled with emergent prompting techniques. Our code and data are open-sourced.",

They learn how to speak and write by reading or listening to others. Actually, writing skill is an ability to pass the process of transforming thought into written communication (Reimer: 2001). Furthermore, teaching writing is as important as finding out techniques of helping students to use their skills effectively on writing. Moreover, there are many techniques of writing, for example prompts, free writing, cluster, and outlining technique. Prompts technique is a technique which sets of questions helping students think about their topic from different angles. In this way, teachers provide some questions to help them writing. Free Writing technique is a technique where the students are asked to write quickly rather than focusing on correctness or sense, outlining technique is done by listing and organizing the ideas appeared in students\u201f mind. This technique is organized in the order in which the information is presented from top down. Another technique is called clustering technique, (Rico. G.L:1983) develops clustering technique which involves writing down a word or phrase and engages it in free association. Each association is written down and connected to the original stimulus by an arrow or line. If association generates further associations, chains of associated words are produced. She also explains that cluster technique is done by starting to write the topic in a circle in the middle of a paper.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Microfluidics is undoubtedly an influential technology that is currently revolutionizing the chemical and biological studies by replicating laboratory benchtop technology on a miniature chip-scale device. In the area of drug delivery science, microfluidics offers advantages, such as accurate dosage, ideal delivery, target-precise delivery, sustainable and controlled release, several dosing, and slight side effects. These helps bring significant assets to the drug delivery systems. Microfluidic technology has been increasingly used for fabrication of drug carriers, direct drug delivery systems, high throughput screening, and formulation and immobilization of drugs. Microfluidic devices present exclusive advantages for the development of efficient drug carrier particles, cell-free protein synthesis systems, and prompt techniques for direct drug screening. Compared to bulk methods, by efficiently controlling the geometries of the fabricated chip and the flow rates of multiphase fluids, microfluidic technology aids the generation of highly stable, uniform, monodispersed particles with higher encapsulation efficiency. In this review, the generation of appropriate drug or gene carriers including different particle types using different structures of microfluidic devices is highlighted. Moreover, this paper discusses the emergence of fabricated microfluidic cell-free protein synthesis systems for potential use at point of care as well as cell-, organ-, and human-on-a-chip models as smart, sensitive, and reproducible platforms, allowing the investigation of the effects of drugs under conditions imitating the biological system.

The optimal operation of the grid, according to a set of predefined technical and economic targets, can be achieved by influencing the behaviors of the decision makers with appropriate market signals. The technical feasibility and performance of the system, for example, in terms of line flow limits, network losses, and appropriate voltage profile, can thus be controlled to a certain extent, by market signals. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for \u201cMarket-based Control\u201d for the operation of emerging distribution systems. Characterized by distributed and adaptive control signals over prosumers, market-based control needs to make prosumer benefits aligned with regulator/DSOs concerns, thus satisfying the requirements from both sides. By applying market-based control in network charging, both network and market performances can be improved. The complexity in the environment and in the interactions among players prompt techniques to be derived from complex systems theory. A multiagent model was built up for testing the market control strategies strategy. The concept and applications are illustrated with reference to a standard CIGRE medium-voltage distribution network.",

Holes can reduce the apparent effectiveness of retrieval systems during evaluation and introduce biases in models trained with incomplete data. In this work, we explore whether large language models can help us fill such holes to improve offline evaluations. We examine an extreme, albeit common, evaluation setting wherein only a single known relevant document per query is available for evaluation. We then explore various approaches for predicting the relevance of unjudged documents with respect to a query and the known relevant document, including nearest neighbor, supervised, and prompting techniques. We find that although the predictions of these One-Shot Labelers (1SL) frequently disagree with human assessments, the labels they produce yield a far more reliable ranking of systems than the single labels do alone. Specifically, the strongest approaches can consistently reach system ranking correlations of over 0.86 with the full rankings over a variety of measures. Meanwhile, the approach substantially increases the reliability of t-tests due to filling holes in relevance assessments, giving researchers more confidence in results they find to be significant. Alongside this work, we release an easy-to-use software package to enable the use of 1SL for evaluation of other ad-hoc collections or systems.",

Both children reached 100% accuracy on all skills by the end of the intervention phase and showed some evidence response generalization and maintenance.

However, so far they have been evaluated primarily on benchmarks where all information in the input context is relevant for solving the task. In this work, we investigate the distractibility of large language models, i.e., how the model problem-solving accuracy can be influenced by irrelevant context. In particular, we introduce Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context (GSM-IC), an arithmetic reasoning dataset with irrelevant information in the problem description. We use this benchmark to measure the distractibility of cutting-edge prompting techniques for large language models, and find that the model performance is dramatically decreased when irrelevant information is included. We also identify several approaches for mitigating this deficiency, such as decoding with self-consistency and adding to the prompt an instruction that tells the language model to ignore the irrelevant information.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly prominent in academia and industry due to their remarkable performance in diverse applications. As these models evolve with increasing parameters, they excel in tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation. However, even models with billions of parameters face challenges in tasks demanding multi-step reasoning. Code generation and comprehension, especially in C and C++, emerge as significant challenges. While LLMs trained on code datasets demonstrate competence in many tasks, they struggle with rectifying non-compilable C and C++ code. Our investigation attributes this subpar performance to two primary factors: the quality of the training dataset and the inherent complexity of the problem which demands intricate reasoning. Existing\"Chain of Thought\"(CoT) prompting techniques aim to enhance multi-step reasoning. This approach, however, retains the limitations associated with the latent drawbacks of LLMs. In this work, we propose CompCodeVet, a compiler-guided CoT approach to produce compilable code from non-compilable ones. Diverging from the conventional approach of utilizing larger LLMs, we employ compilers as a teacher to establish a more robust zero-shot thought process. The evaluation of CompCodeVet on two open-source code datasets shows that CompCodeVet has the ability to improve the training dataset quality for LLMs.",

The emergence of such abilities carries profound implications for the future direction of research in NLP, especially as the deployment of such models becomes more prevalent. However, one key challenge is that the evaluation of these abilities is often confounded by competencies that arise in models through alternative prompting techniques, such as in-context learning and instruction following, which also emerge as the models are scaled up. In this study, we provide the first comprehensive examination of these emergent abilities while accounting for various potentially biasing factors that can influence the evaluation of models. We conduct rigorous tests on a set of 18 models, encompassing a parameter range from 60 million to 175 billion parameters, across a comprehensive set of 22 tasks. Through an extensive series of over 1,000 experiments, we provide compelling evidence that emergent abilities can primarily be ascribed to in-context learning. We find no evidence for the emergence of reasoning abilities, thus providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving the observed abilities and thus alleviating safety concerns regarding their use.",

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to enrich the text-based class labels by enhancing the descriptiveness of the class names. However, these improvements are restricted to the text-based classifier only, and the query visual features are not considered. In this paper, we propose a framework which combines pre-trained discriminative VLMs with pre-trained generative video-to-text and text-to-text models. We introduce two key modifications to the standard zero-shot setting. First, we propose language-guided visual feature enhancement and employ a video-to-text model to convert the query video to its descriptive form. The resulting descriptions contain vital visual cues of the query video, such as what objects are present and their spatio-temporal interactions. These descriptive cues provide additional semantic knowledge to VLMs to enhance their zeroshot performance. Second, we propose video-specific prompts to LLMs to generate more meaningful descriptions to enrich class label representations. Specifically, we introduce prompt techniques to create a Tree Hierarchy of Categories for class names, offering a higher-level action context for additional visual cues, We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in video understanding across three different zero-shot settings: 1) video action recognition, 2) video-to-text and textto-video retrieval, and 3) time-sensitive video tasks. Consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks and with various VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our code will be made publicly available.",

To lower the barrier of such a task, research efforts have been devoted to developing interactive approaches for data transformation, but many approaches still presume that their users have considerable knowledge of various data transformation concepts and functions. In this study, we leverage natural language (NL) as the primary interaction modality to improve the accessibility of average users to performing complex data transformation and facilitate intuitive table generation and editing. Designing an NL-driven data transformation approach introduces two challenges: a) NL-driven synthesis of interpretable pipelines and b) incremental refinement of synthesized tables. To address these challenges, we present NL2Rigel, an interactive tool that assists users in synthesizing and improving tables from semi-structured text with NL instructions. Based on a large language model and prompting techniques, NL2Rigel can interpret the given NL instructions into a table synthesis pipeline corresponding to Rigel specifications, a declarative language for tabular data transformation. An intuitive interface is designed to visualize the synthesis pipeline and the generated tables, helping users understand the transformation process and refine the results efficiently with targeted NL instructions. The comprehensiveness of NL2Rigel is demonstrated with an example gallery, and we further confirmed NL2Rigel's usability with a comparative user study by showing that the task completion time with NL2Rigel is significantly shorter than that with the original version of Rigel with comparable completion rates.",

This model and its underlying theory were then used to construct a new requirements elicitation prompting technique. To provide a context for testing the relative effectiveness of the new technique, two other questioning methodologies were also operationalized as prompting techniques: (1) the interrogatories technique, which involves asking \"who,\" \"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" \"how,\" and \"why\"; questions; and (2) a semantic questioning scheme, which involves asking questions based on a theoretical model of knowledge structures. To measure the usefulness of the prompting techniques in eliciting requirements, a set of generic requirements categories was adapted from previous research to capture requirements evoked by users. The effectiveness of the three methods in eliciting requirements for a software application was then tested in an experiment with users. Results showed that the new prompting technique elicited a greater quantity of requirements from users than did the other two techniques.

Although prompting techniques are routinely used by caregivers and health care providers to aid individuals with cognitive impairment in maintaining their independence with everyday activities, there is no clear consensus or gold standard regarding prompt content, method of instruction, timing of delivery, or interface of prompt delivery in the gerontology or technology literatures. In this paper, we demonstrate how cognitive rehabilitation principles can inform and advance the development of more effective assistive prompting technologies that could be employed in smart environments. We first describe cognitive rehabilitation theory (CRT) and show how it provides a useful theoretical foundation for guiding the development of assistive technologies for IADL completion. We then use the CRT framework to critically review existing smart prompting technologies to answer questions that will be integral to advancing development of effective smart prompting technologies. Finally, we raise questions for future exploration as well as challenges and suggestions for future directions in this area of research.",

However, existing methods focus only on a single object per subject-relation pair, even though often multiple objects are correct. To overcome this limitation, we analyze these representations for their potential to yield materialized multi-object relational knowledge. We formulate the problem as a rank-then-select task. For ranking candidate objects, we evaluate existing prompting techniques and propose new ones incorporating domain knowledge. Among the selection methods, we find that choosing objects with a likelihood above a learned relation-specific threshold gives a 49.5% F1 score.

Despite this progress, LLMs are still unable to solve algorithmic reasoning problems. While providing a rationale with the final answer has led to further improvements in multi-step reasoning problems, Anil et al. 2022 showed that even simple algorithmic reasoning tasks such as parity are far from solved. In this work, we identify and study four key stages for successfully teaching algorithmic reasoning to LLMs: (1) formulating algorithms as skills, (2) teaching multiple skills simultaneously (skill accumulation), (3) teaching how to combine skills (skill composition) and (4) teaching how to use skills as tools. We show that it is possible to teach algorithmic reasoning to LLMs via in-context learning, which we refer to as algorithmic prompting. We evaluate our approach on a variety of arithmetic and quantitative reasoning tasks, and demonstrate significant boosts in performance over existing prompting techniques. In particular, for long parity, addition, multiplication and subtraction, we achieve an error reduction of approximately 10x, 9x, 5x and 2x respectively compared to the best available baselines.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models have excelled in remarkable reasoning capabilities with advanced prompting techniques, but they fall short on tasks that require exploration, strategic foresight, and sequential decision-making. Recent works propose to utilize external programs to define search logic, such that LLMs can perform passive tree search to solve more challenging reasoning tasks. Though impressive results have been achieved, there are several fundamental limitations of these approaches. First, passive tree searches are not efficient as they usually require multiple rounds of LLM API calls to solve one single problem. Moreover, passive search methods are not flexible since they need task-specific program designs. Then a natural question arises: can we maintain the tree-search capability of LLMs without the aid of external programs, and can still generate responses that clearly demonstrate the process of a tree-structure search? To this end, we propose a new concept called autonomous tree-search ability of LLM, which can automatically generate a response containing search trajectories for the correct answer. Concretely, we perform search trajectories using capable LLM API via a fixed system prompt, allowing them to perform autonomous tree-search (ATS) right out of the box. Experiments on 4 puzzle games demonstrate our method can achieve huge improvements. The ATS-BFS method outperforms the Chain of Thought approach by achieving an average accuracy improvement of 33%. Compared to Tree of Thoughts, it requires 65.6% or 47.7% less GPT-api cost to attain a comparable level of accuracy. Moreover, we have collected data using the ATS prompt method and fine-tuned LLaMA. This approach yield a greater improvement compared to the ones fine-tuned on CoT data. Specifically, it outperforms CoT-tuned LLaMAs by an average of 40.6% and 38.5% for LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B, respectively.",

        "abstract": "We revisit and advance visual prompting (VP), an input prompting technique for vision tasks. VP can reprogram a fixed, pre-trained source model to accomplish downstream tasks in the target domain by simply incorporating universal prompts (in terms of input perturbation patterns) into downstream data points. Yet, it remains elusive why VP stays effective even given a ruleless label mapping (LM) between the source classes and the target classes. Inspired by the above, we ask: How is LM interrelated with VP? And how to exploit such a relationship to improve its accuracy on target tasks? We peer into the influence of LM on VP and provide an affirmative answer that a better \u2018quality\u2019 of LM (assessed by mapping precision and explanation) can consistently improve the effectiveness of VP. This is in contrast to the prior art where the factor of LM was missing. To optimize LM, we propose a new VP framework, termed ILM-VP (iterative label mapping-based visual prompting), which automatically re-maps the source labels to the target labels and progressively improves the target task accuracy of VP. Further, when using a contrastive language-image pretrained (CLIP) model for VP, we propose to integrate an LM process to assist the text prompt selection of CLIP and to improve the target task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VP methods. As highlighted below, we show that when reprogramming an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-18 to 13 target tasks, ILM-VP outperforms baselines by a substantial margin, e.g., 7.9% and 6.7% accuracy improvements in transfer learning to the target Flowers102 and CIFAR100 datasets. Besides, our proposal on CLIP-based VP provides 13.7% and 7.1% accuracy improvements on Flowers102 and DTD respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/ILM-VP.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are showcasing impressive ability in handling complex reasoning tasks. In real-world situations, problems often span a spectrum of complexities. Humans inherently adjust their problem-solving approaches based on task complexity. However, most methodologies that leverage LLMs tend to adopt a uniform approach: utilizing consistent models, prompting methods, and degrees of problem decomposition, regardless of the problem complexity. Inflexibility of them can bring unnecessary computational overhead or sub-optimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce an Adaptive-Solver framework. It strategically modulates solving strategies based on the difficulties of the problems. Given an initial solution, the framework functions with two primary modules. The initial evaluation module assesses the adequacy of the current solution. If improvements are needed, the subsequent adaptation module comes into play. Within this module, three key adaptation strategies are employed: (1) Model Adaptation: Switching to a stronger LLM when a weaker variant is inadequate. (2) Prompting Method Adaptation: Alternating between different prompting techniques to suit the problem's nuances. (3) Decomposition Granularity Adaptation: Breaking down a complex problem into more fine-grained sub-questions to enhance solvability. Through such dynamic adaptations, our framework not only enhances computational efficiency but also elevates the overall performance. This dual-benefit ensures both the efficiency of the system for simpler tasks and the precision required for more complex questions. Experimental results from complex reasoning tasks reveal that the prompting method adaptation and decomposition granularity adaptation enhance performance across all tasks. Furthermore, the model adaptation approach significantly reduces API costs (up to 50%) while maintaining superior performance.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of two error correction (EC) procedures: modeling alone and the use of an error statement plus modeling. Utilizing an alternating treatments design nested into a multiple baseline design across participants, we sought to evaluate and compare the effects of these two EC procedures used to teach two sets of labels. Three children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder participated in this study. Results demonstrated that all participants acquired targeted labels in both EC conditions, and maintained high-levels of correct responding at follow-up. Only one participant acquired skills more quickly in the modeling alone condition. Future directions for additional research pertaining to effective and efficient EC procedures are discussed. Discrete trial teaching (DTT) is a widely implemented teaching procedure for children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Smith, 2001). DTT involves three components: a discriminative stimulus (S), the learner\u2019s response, and a specific consequence (i.e., reinforcement or punishment) that varies based on the learner\u2019s response. While efforts are made to ensure that the learner engages in correct responding, there are instances in which a child will make an error. When an error occurs, the instructor may deliver a stimulus intended to reduce the likelihood that the child will continue to engage in an incorrect response, or punish the incorrect response, sometimes called error correction (EC) (Leaf, Sheldon, & Sherman, 2010). There are multiple ways that an instructor can implement EC procedures. This can include: response repetition/rehearsal (Carroll, Joachim, St. Peter, & Robisnon, 2015; McGhan & Lerman, 2013; Worsdell, et al., 2005), a brief time-out (Carroll et al., 2015; Turan, Moroz, & Croteau, 2012), delivering verbal feedback/error statement (e.g., \u201cno, that\u2019s not it\u201d) (McGhan & Lerman, 2013), active student responding (Barbetta, Heron, & Heward, 1993; McGhan & Lerman, 2013), modeling (McGhan & Lerman, 2013), or a combination of techniques such as a brief time-out and additional task repetition (Turan, Moroz, & Croteau, 2012), an error statement in combination with a remedial trial (Leaf et al., 2010), or an error statement, modeling, and a remedial trial (Leaf, Leaf, Taubman, McEachin, & Delmolino, 2014). Smith, Mruzek, Wheat, and Hughest (2006) sought to compare three different EC procedures. In this study, the authors compared the effects of a) modeling, b) delivering an error statement, and c) providing no feedback contingent on incorrect responses to teach six children with autism matching wordto-picture skills employing DTT. These six children ranged in age from 3 to 7 years old and based upon scores on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and the Vineand Adaptive Behavior Scales participants ranged on functioning level within the study. All six participants had a history of exposure to modeling prompts within DTT, but only two had a previous history of exposure to error statement procedures. Utilizing an alternating treatments design, the researchers measured the number of trials to mastery to compare the rate of acquisition across EC procedures. Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Justin B. Leaf, Autism Partnership Foundation, 200 Marina Drive, Seal Beach, CA 90808.

These results suggested that some learners may acquire skills more rapidly depending on the EC procedure. Leaf and colleagues (2014) compared a prompting procedure to an EC procedure to teach expressive labels to children (ages 4 to 6 years old) with autism. All participants could be described as high functioning individuals with autism. All had received behavioral treatment, and were attending school with supports. The prompting procedure and the EC procedure were implemented as part of discrete trial teaching. The EC procedure included an error statement, similar to Smith et al. (2006), however, the procedure also utilized modeling and remedial trials. The outcome of the study demonstrated that the prompting procedure was more efficient, but both the prompting procedure and the EC procedure were effective. In another study, Turan, Moroz, and Croteau (2012) compared two types of EC procedures (i.e., Delay and Independent Probe). The first procedure involved a brief time-out, identified as a delay condition, in which a 5 s intertrial interval occurred following an incorrect response, then the re-presentation of the S and a prompt to engage in the target response using least to most prompting techniques. The second procedure also utilized a brief time-out, but with the addition of a distractor trial. This was referred to as an independent probe condition and consisted of a 3 s intertrial interval following an incorrect response, then the re-presentation of the S and a prompt to engage in the target response using least to most prompting. Following the learners response, the instructor then presented an instruction for the participant to engage in a previously mastered skill, referred to as a distractor trial. After the distractor trial, the instructor returned to presenting trials related to the target response. Three individuals diagnosed with autism participated in this study; their ages ranged from 6 to 8 years old. Two of the three participants received intensive behavioral intervention prior to the onset of the study. A within-session alternating treatments design was conducted in the first study in order to compare the effects of both EC conditions to teach receptive language tasks. In the second study, an alternating treatments design was conducted to compare both EC conditions to teach tacts. The results indicated that the most efficient EC procedure, while it differed across participants, maintained across topographically different skill sets. In 2013 McGhan and Lerman sought to identify the effects of a rapid EC assessment as a means of determining the least intrusive, yet most effective EC procedure for five children with ASD. The participants were initially exposed to four different EC conditions that made up the rapid EC assessment (i.e., error statement, modeling, active student responding, and rehearsal). The children that participated in this study ranged in age from 4 to 6 years old. All participants were receiving behavior analytic instruction at the time of the study. The participants\u2019 demonstrated at least a basic receptive repertoire. Communication varied across participants. Following exposure to all four EC conditions, the researchers targeted additional skills in three EC conditions based on the results; the researchers took the least intrusive, most efficient procedure and compared it to a procedure that was more intrusive and a procedure that was less intrusive. For four out of the five participants, the least intrusive, most efficient procedure identified in the rapid assessment remained as such when compared to a more intrusive and least intrusive procedure. This study also identified the least intrusive, most efficient procedure varied across learners. These studies demonstrated the effectiveness of a variety of EC procedures for children with autism. The need still exists for researchers to determine the most efficient EC procedures because the efficiency may vary depending on the individual (McGhan & Lerman, 2013; Smith et al., 2006). To begin this process, it may be helpful to identify certain characteristics and prerequisite skills of learners to see how that is associated with the efficiency of a particular EC procedure. One group of learners that share similar prerequisite skills are children who are identified as high functioning as they tend to acquire skills quickly, score higher on IQ testing, and demonstrate social communicative behavior similar to their typically developing peers (with minor idiosyncratic differences). One may assume these 92 / Education and Training in Autism and Developmental Disabilities-March 2017 learners acquire skills when EC procedures are utilized; however, little empirical data captures this assumption. The purpose of this study is to provide empirical evidence to compare how children with ASD described as higher-functioning acquire expressive labels when exposed to two different EC procedures. The two procedures selected for this study were a modeling procedure (Smith et al., 2006) and an error statement plus modeling procedure, modified from Leaf et al. (2014). These procedures, while very similar, were selected because they are assumed to be the least intrusive EC techniques commonly utilized in clinical practices. This study will provide an analysis of skill acquisition, efficiency of both EC procedures, and maintenance of target skills given respective EC procedures.",

These methods typically combine learnable textual tokens with class tokens as input for models with frozen parameters. However, they often employ a single prompt to describe class contexts, failing to capture categories' diverse attributes adequately. This study introduces the Partitioned Multi-modal Prompt (PMPO), a multi-modal prompting technique that extends the soft prompt from a single learnable prompt to multiple prompts. Our method divides the visual encoder depths and connects learnable prompts to the separated visual depths, enabling different prompts to capture the hierarchical contextual depths of visual representations. Furthermore, to maximize the advantages of multi-prompt learning, we incorporate prior information from manually designed templates and learnable multi-prompts, thus improving the generalization capabilities of our approach. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three challenging tasks: new class generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization. For instance, our method achieves a $79.28$ harmonic mean, averaged over 11 diverse image recognition datasets ($+7.62$ compared to CoOp), demonstrating significant competitiveness compared to state-of-the-art prompting methods.",

Chained tasks are of different types, for example, self-care skills such as eating, toileting, and dressing; gross motor skills such as walking, running, and jumping rope; fine motor skills such as plucking, tearing, cutting, and painting; and daily living skills such as phoning and shopping. These skills, acquired from early childhood on, positively affect both children's school years and future life as an independent individual (Mechling, Pridgen, & Cronin, 2005; Snell & Brown, 1993; Varol, 2005).Modeling is a teaching technique used frequently in teaching new behaviors to individuals with intellectual disabilities; its effectiveness has been supported by numerous studies (Rehfeldt, Dahman, Young, Cherry, & Davis, 2003). Six types of video technology issues have been discussed in the literature: a) video feedback, b) video modeling, c) video self-modeling, d) subjective point of view video modeling, e) video prompting, and f) computer-based video instruction (Mechling, 2005; Murray & Noland, 2013; Oncul & Ozkan, 2010).Video prompting requires the respondent to watch a segment of a video recording and actively respond to the prompt in the video. In contrast to other video teaching methods, video prompting does not require the respondent to watch a video from beginning to the end before performing the behavior. Instead, the respondent is expected to watch a segment of the video and give an immediate active response to the video prompt. Depending on the subjects' response, the video recording is continued or repeated by the researcher the respondent (Mechling, 2005; Norman, Collins, & Schuster, 2001).Chained tasks are more complicated skills consisting of more than one sequential, single-step behaviors. Performance of these tasks takes time. Video prompting appears to be an effective way to enable students with intellectual disabilities to acquire target behaviors (Horn et al., 2008). Thus, the video prompting technique has been used in this study. The literature, though limited, contains studies with experimental designs and a single subject, carried out by using video prompting to allow students to acquire chained tasks. Previous studies have used the video prompting technique to help intellectually disabled or developmentally delayed students acquire daily living skills and self-care skills such as setting a table (Norman et al., 2001), organizing food bought from a green-grocer (Cannella-Malone et al., 2006), cooking (Graves, Collins, Schuster, & Kleinert, 2005), washing clothes (Horn et al., 2008), and washing dishes (Sigafoos et al., 2007). At the end of these studies, the target chained tasks were acquired by these students.Planning the training environment is at least as important as planning the training syllabus for helping students with disabilities acquire new behaviors. In general, one-to-one training for moderately and severely disabled students is effective; however, group instruction is another effective alternative with several advantages over one-to-one teaching: a) teachers can train more than one student, b) group training requires fewer personnel and less teaching time, c) students can earn more functional skills in a less-restrictive environment, d) they can develop appropriate skills for communicating with their peers, and e) they can acquire extra knowledge by observing other students in the group (Collins, Gast, Ault, & Wolery, 1991; Ledford, Gast, Luscre, & Ayres, 2008). \u2026",

        "abstract": "Background Children today get access to smartphones at an early age. However, their ability to use mobile apps has not yet been studied in detail. Purpose This study aimed to assess the ability of children aged 2\u20138 years to perform touchscreen gestures and follow prompting techniques, i.e., ways apps provide instructions on how to use them. Methods We developed one mobile app to test the ability of children to perform various touchscreen gestures and another mobile app to test their ability to follow various prompting techniques. We used these apps in this study of 90 children in a kindergarten and a primary school in New Delhi in July 2019. We noted the touchscreen gestures that the children could perform and the most sophisticated prompting technique that they could follow. Results Two- and 3-year-old children could not follow any prompting technique and only a minority (27%) could tap the touchscreen at an intended place. Four- to 6-year-old children could perform simple gestures like a tap and slide (57%) and follow instructions provided through animation (63%). Seven- and 8-year-old children could perform more sophisticated gestures like dragging and dropping (30%) and follow instructions provided in audio and video formats (34%). We observed a significant difference between the number of touchscreen gestures that the children could perform and the number of prompting techniques that they could follow (F=544.0407, P<0.05). No significant difference was observed in the performance of female versus male children (P>0.05). Conclusion Children gradually learn to use mobile apps beginning at 2 years of age. They become comfortable performing single-finger gestures and following nontextual prompting techniques by 8 years of age. We recommend that these results be considered in the development of mobile apps for children.",

        "abstract": "Video game testing requires game-specific knowledge as well as common sense reasoning about the events in the game. While AI-driven agents can satisfy the first requirement, it is not yet possible to meet the second requirement automatically. Therefore, video game testing often still relies on manual testing, and human testers are required to play the game thoroughly to detect bugs. As a result, it is challenging to fully automate game testing. In this study, we explore the possibility of leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of large language models for video game bug detection. By formulating the bug detection problem as a question-answering task, we show that large language models can identify which event is buggy in a sequence of textual descriptions of events from a game. To this end, we introduce the GameBugDescriptions benchmark dataset, which consists of 167 buggy gameplay videos and a total of 334 question-answer pairs across 8 games. We extensively evaluate the performance of six models across the OPT and InstructGPT large language model families on our benchmark dataset. Our results show promising results for employing language models to detect video game bugs. With the proper prompting technique, we could achieve an accuracy of 70.66%, and on some video games, up to 78.94%.

        "abstract": "Collecting diverse human data on subjective NLP topics is costly and challenging. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed human-like capabilities, there is a recent trend in collaborative efforts between humans and LLMs for generating diverse data, offering potential scalable and efficient solutions. However, the extent of LLMs' capability to generate diverse perspectives on subjective topics remains an unexplored question. In this study, we investigate LLMs' capacity for generating diverse perspectives and rationales on subjective topics, such as social norms and argumentative texts. We formulate this problem as diversity extraction in LLMs and propose a criteria-based prompting technique to ground diverse opinions and measure perspective diversity from the generated criteria words. Our results show that measuring semantic diversity through sentence embeddings and distance metrics is not enough to measure perspective diversity. To see how far we can extract diverse perspectives from LLMs, or called diversity coverage, we employ a step-by-step recall prompting for generating more outputs from the model in an iterative manner. As we apply our prompting method to other tasks (hate speech labeling and story continuation), indeed we find that LLMs are able to generate diverse opinions according to the degree of task subjectivity.",

        "abstract": "ChatGPT has sparked both excitement and skepticism in education. To analyze its impact on teaching and learning it is crucial to understand how students perceive ChatGPT and assess its potential and challenges. Toward this, we conducted a two-stage study with senior students in a computer engineering program ( $n=56$ ). In the first stage, we asked the students to evaluate ChatGPT using their own words after they used it to complete one learning activity. The returned responses (3136 words) were analyzed by coding and theme building (36 codes and 15 themes). In the second stage, we used the derived codes and themes to create a 27-item questionnaire. The students responded to this questionnaire three weeks later after completing other activities with the help of ChatGPT. The results show that the students admire the capabilities of ChatGPT and find it interesting, motivating, and helpful for study and work. They find it easy to use and appreciate its human-like interface that provides well-structured responses and good explanations. However, many students feel that ChatGPT\u2019s answers are not always accurate and most of them believe that it requires good background knowledge to work with since it does not replace human intelligence. So, most students think that ChatGPT needs to be improved but are optimistic that this will happen soon. When it comes to the negative impact of ChatGPT on learning, academic integrity, jobs, and life, the students are divided. We conclude that ChatGPT can and should be used for learning. However, students should be aware of its limitations. Educators should try using ChatGPT and guide students on effective prompting techniques and how to assess generated responses. The developers should improve their models to enhance the accuracy of given answers. The study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.",

With the explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their already ubiquitous presence in our daily lives, it is becoming increasingly necessary to verify their real-world understanding. Inspired by cognitive theories, we propose POSQA: a Physical Object Size Question Answering dataset with simple size comparison questions to examine the extremity and analyze the potential mechanisms of the embodied comprehension of the latest LLMs. We show that even the largest LLMs today perform poorly under the zero-shot setting. We then push their limits with advanced prompting techniques and external knowledge augmentation. Furthermore, we investigate whether their real-world comprehension primarily derives from contextual information or internal weights and analyse the impact of prompt formats and report bias of different objects. Our results show that real-world understanding that LLMs shaped from textual data can be vulnerable to deception and confusion by the surface form of prompts, which makes it less aligned with human behaviours.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the precipitation of a thin layer of a polymer solution was proposed to imitate the process of asymmetric membrane formation by a non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) technique. The phase inversion within the thin (<500 \u03bcm) and bulk (~2 cm) layer of polyamic-acid (PAA) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) by using water as non-solvent was considered. It was shown that polymer films formed within the \u201climited\u201d layer of polymer solution showed a good agreement with the morphology of corresponded asymmetric flat-sheet membranes even in the case of three-component casting solution (PAA/NMP/EtOH). At the same time, the polymer films formed on the interface of two bulk phases (\u201cinfinite\u201d regime) did not fully correspond to the membrane structure. It was shown that up to 50% of NMP solvent in PAA solution can be replaced by ethanol, which can have a renewable origin. By changing the ethanol content in the casting solution, the average size of transport pores can be varied in the range of 12\u201380 nm, and the liquid permeance from 16.6 up to 207 kg/m2\u2219h\u2219bar. To summarize, the precipitation of polymer solution within the thin layer can be considered a prompt technique and a powerful tool for fast screening and optimization of the complex composition of casting solutions using its small quantity. Furthermore, the prediction of membrane morphology can be done without casting the membrane, further post-treatment procedures, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis.",

We found that children under 3 were only able to interpret instructions when they came from an adult model, but that children made rapid gains between age 3 and 3-and-a-half, at which point they were able to follow in-app audio instructions and on-screen demonstrations. The common technique of using visual state changes to prompt gestures was ineffective across this age range.

        "abstract": "This paper presents the FormAI dataset, a large collection of 112, 000 AI-generated compilable and independent C programs with vulnerability classification. We introduce a dynamic zero-shot prompting technique constructed to spawn diverse programs utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset is generated by GPT-3.5-turbo and comprises programs with varying levels of complexity. Some programs handle complicated tasks like network management, table games, or encryption, while others deal with simpler tasks like string manipulation. Every program is labeled with the vulnerabilities found within the source code, indicating the type, line number, and vulnerable function name. This is accomplished by employing a formal verification method using the Efficient SMT-based Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC), which uses model checking, abstract interpretation, constraint programming, and satisfiability modulo theories to reason over safety/security properties in programs. This approach definitively detects vulnerabilities and offers a formal model known as a counterexample, thus eliminating the possibility of generating false positive reports.

        "abstract": "The Rust programming language, with its safety guarantees, has established itself as a viable choice for low-level systems programming language over the traditional, unsafe alternatives like C/C++. These guarantees come from a strong ownership-based type system, as well as primitive support for features like closures, pattern matching, etc., that make the code more concise and amenable to reasoning. These unique Rust features also pose a steep learning curve for programmers. This paper presents a tool called RustAssistant that leverages the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically suggest fixes for Rust compilation errors. RustAssistant uses a careful combination of prompting techniques as well as iteration with an LLM to deliver high accuracy of fixes. RustAssistant is able to achieve an impressive peak accuracy of roughly 74% on real-world compilation errors in popular open-source Rust repositories. We plan to release our dataset of Rust compilation errors to enable further research.",

We include perturbations at multiple levels of abstractions (e.g. lexical perturbations such as typos, and semantic perturbations such as the inclusion of intermediate reasoning steps in the questions) to conduct behavioral analysis on the LLMs. Throughout our experiments, we find that models are more sensitive to certain perturbations such as replacing words with their synonyms. We also demonstrate that increasing the proportion of perturbed exemplars in the prompts improves the robustness of few-shot prompting methods.",

However, most of these agents rely on few-shot prompting techniques with off-the-shelf LMs. In this paper, we investigate and argue for the overlooked direction of fine-tuning LMs to obtain language agents. Using a setup of question answering (QA) with a Google search API, we explore a variety of base LMs, prompting methods, fine-tuning data, and QA tasks, and find language agents are consistently improved after fine-tuning their backbone LMs. For example, fine-tuning Llama2-7B with 500 agent trajectories generated by GPT-4 leads to a 77% HotpotQA performance increase. Furthermore, we propose FireAct, a novel approach to fine-tuning LMs with trajectories from multiple tasks and prompting methods, and show having more diverse fine-tuning data can further improve agents. Along with other findings regarding scaling effects, robustness, generalization, efficiency and cost, our work establishes comprehensive benefits of fine-tuning LMs for agents, and provides an initial set of experimental designs, insights, as well as open questions toward language agent fine-tuning.",

The backward process generates a question that match a sampled reasoning chain, so that the question is solvable and clear.

Prompting can be defined generally as the pairing of a cue, the stimulus that is to control a response when training is completed, with a prompt, a stimulus which already controls or partially controls the desired response. The object of training sequences using prompts is to shift the control of the response from the prompt to the cue with which the prompt is paired. Although there have been some notable successes with prompted training sequences, there also have been anomalies. There is still much to be learned about conditions under which prompting techniques can be used to advantage (Anderson, 1967).

There is a significant amount of evidence suggesting that children are unable to give a reliable account. Their cognitive ability to perceive a questionable situation is not fully developed, and neither is their ability to recall memories. In order to examine the different variables surrounding this issue, a literature review was conducted. The results of numerous studies suggest that although children may not be the most reliable witnesses, sometimes they are the only witnesses. The following literature review discusses the conditions under which children give the best recall, and under which they give the worst. Future policies regarding children in the legal context may be shaped from research such as the following. CHILDREN GIVING EYEWITNESS TESTIMONIES 3 Children Giving Eyewitness Testimonies in a Court of Law For years now, professionals and government officials alike have debated countless issues in our legal system. One particular issue is of great interest to psychologists, however. The issue is that of children giving an eyewitness testimony in a court of law. Many researchers have provided evidence supporting the argument that children do not possess the capability to give an accurate eyewitness account. Whether the child on stand is an innocent victim or witness, or a suspect in a crime, his or her testimony should be judged with caution, as research shows evidence against the reliability of such testimonies (Owen-Kostelnik, Reppucci, & Meyer, 2006). Not only does research suggest that they do not possess the ability, but there are also many risks related to their doing so. This idea of limiting the amount of involvement children can have in the conviction of criminal behavior exists to protect both children and adults. There have been countless examples of innocent men and women who were falsely convicted of a crime, and unjustly punished (Owen-Kostelnik et al., 2006). On the other side, there have been countless examples of men and women who are guilty of committing a crime against a child who unjustly escape conviction. Many times the consensus falls into the hands of only one witness-a child. It is not uncommon for a child to be the only witness of a crime, specifically if the child is the victim. Therefore, it is important to understand the conditions under which children give the best testimony, and the implications regarding the issue. With a better understanding of this issue, hopefully measures can be taken in the legal system to adjust laws and policies involving the child testimony process. In the following literature review, I will examine the current evidence regarding this hot topic, and explore the arguments in depth. CHILDREN GIVING EYEWITNESS TESTIMONIES 4 Memory Development Memory recall At the heart of this hot debate lies the issue of memory development in children. When a child is placed on stand at a trial, he or she is given the responsibility of recalling an event in order to bring the situation to light, and either defend or prosecute the person on trial. Memory recall, or retrieval as some call it, is the retrieval of information that one has previously learned or witnessed with any of the five senses. In order for memory recall to occur, an individual must go through a process of encoding information, storing it, and then retrieving, or recalling it (Alessi & Ballard, 2001). Another important way to describe memory is by doing so through the informationprocessing theory, which utilizes the terms short term memory and long term memory. This process begins by information entering the brain through any of the five senses, where it is stored for no longer than about one second (Alessi & Ballard, 2001). The information then can move to the short term memory (STM), to be stored for about 30 seconds. This STM, also known as working memory, can store up to seven to nine pieces of information at a time. How then, you ask, can people remember things for long periods of time, and build a \"memory\"? This is done through the transfer of information to the long term memory (LTM). It is important to keep in mind that the STM and LTM are not physical regions of the brain that we can pinpoint (Alessi & Ballard, 2001). The entire brain plays a part in making up the STM and LTM. The process by which information moves from the short term memory to the long term memory varies from time to time. There are different techniques that one can use to facilitate the transfer-some of which are more successful than others. These strategies include rehearsing information repetitively, thinking of different ways to code the information into the brain, and CHILDREN GIVING EYEWITNESS TESTIMONIES 5 \"chunking,\" which is a fancy term for grouping similar pieces of information together for easy access next time the information needs to be retrieved (Alessi & Ballard, 2001). The key to retaining information is to minimize the randomness of it all, and make it mean something. Once it is made \"meaningful,\" as Alessi and Ballard put it, it will then be easily accessible. Sometimes the information may be stored, but if it wasn't chunked together properly, it gets lost in the mixture of random memories, and can't be retrieved easily (Alessi & Ballard, 2001). Age differences. There are different types of memory, and as children grow up and develop a higher functioning brain, they develop more complex memory recall processes. For example, infants develop memory in the first few weeks of life. They remember who mom and dad are from the very beginning. But specifically, \"recall memory\" is not developed until about 6 or 7 months. The previously mentioned retrieval process is not fully developed until later in life, which explains why adults cannot remember events that took place while they were infants (Alessi & Ballard, 2001). Looking at the bigger picture, memory develops as a function of brain development. In Alessi and Ballard's review, they state that certain areas of the brain do not even finish developing until adolescence. For example, the myelin sheath on the brain's neurons plays a vital role in memory. The sheath serves to prevent electrical signals from randomly firing throughout the brain. As the brain develops from infancy to childhood, and to adolescence, myelin sheaths become more abundant, and therefore facilitate smooth and efficient transfer of electricity. Research has shown that the levels of memory function and cognitive abilities in a child are affected by the amount of myelinated neurons (Alessi & Ballard, 2001). There are certain sections of the brain that don't finish myelinating until later childhood, like the corpus callosum for example. The corpus callosum plays an important role in the brain, as it helps facilitate CHILDREN GIVING EYEWITNESS TESTIMONIES 6 communication between the two halves of the brain, allowing for higher mental processes to take place. It is not until around the age of 10 that the corpus callosum is fully myelinated (Alessi & Ballard, 2001). Simcock and Hayne (2002) researched the phenomenon that children are incapable of verbally reporting experiences that may have happened to them before they developed the ability to express themselves verbally. In other words, if the child had not developed language skills at the time the information was encoded into the brain, they will not report the critical event. Simcock and Hayne present us with the concept of childhood or infantile amnesia, which is the term used when one cannot remember the events from infancy and early childhood. Originally researched by Sigmund Freud, Simcock and Hayne reinforce this phenomenon as they provide evidence stating that this childhood amnesia is related to language development. It is widely accepted that adults can remember events of their own lives back to about the age of 3 or 4. Childhood amnesia would then explain why they cannot remember events before that. In their longitudinal study, Simcock and Hayne (2002) confirmed this idea. How then, is it possible to elicit a testimony from a child when his or her memory may not be fully developed? According to Goodman and Melinder (2007), memory recall can be affected by prompting techniques. It makes a difference whether or not children are prompted to retrieve information when prompted by verbal cues and questioning versus by play interactions. Research suggests that younger children are not able to recall information when given verbal cues as well as older children and adults are (Goodman & Melinder, 2007). This is why props and play techniques are utilized, despite the controversy involving suggestibility (which we will",

For instance, they may have parametric knowledge about the ordering of countries by size or may be able to rank reviews by sentiment. Recent work focuses on pairwise, pointwise, and listwise prompting techniques to elicit a language model's ranking knowledge. However, we find that even with careful calibration and constrained decoding, prompting-based techniques may not always be self-consistent in the rankings they produce. This motivates us to explore an alternative approach that is inspired by an unsupervised probing method called Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS). The idea is to train a probing model guided by a logical constraint: a model's representation of a statement and its negation must be mapped to contrastive true-false poles consistently across multiple statements. We hypothesize that similar constraints apply to ranking tasks where all items are related via consistent pairwise or listwise comparisons. To this end, we extend the binary CCS method to Contrast-Consistent Ranking (CCR) by adapting existing ranking methods such as the Max-Margin Loss, Triplet Loss, and Ordinal Regression objective. Our results confirm that, for the same language model, CCR probing outperforms prompting and even performs on a par with prompting much larger language models.",

The families of 51 children who needed immediate dental care (determined by dental screens ing at a local school) were placed into three matched groups and randomly assigned to the treatment conditions: One Prompt (Note Only), Three Prompt (Note, Telephone Contact, Home Visit), and One Prompt plus $5 Incentive. The Three Prompt and One Prompt plus $5 Incentive were significantly more effective in initiating dental visits than the Note-Only procedure. Not only was the One Prompt plus $5 Incentive technique effective in producing a slightly larger percentage of initial dental visits compared to the Three-Prompt technique, it also produced a significantly larger number of followup visits. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness analysis showed the Incentive condition to be less costly than the Three-Prompt condition in encouraging initial dental visits.

However, while accuracy is essential, it is also important for such reasoners to\"know what they know\", which can be quantified through the calibration of the model. In this paper, we compare the calibration of Program Aided Language Models (PAL) and text-based Chain-of-thought (COT) prompting techniques over 5 datasets and 2 model types: LLaMA models and OpenAI models. Our results indicate that PAL leads to improved calibration in 75% of the instances. Our analysis uncovers that prompting styles that produce lesser diversity in generations also have more calibrated results, and thus we also experiment with inducing lower generation diversity using temperature scaling and find that for certain temperatures, PAL is not only more accurate but is also more calibrated than COT. Overall, we demonstrate that, in the majority of cases, program-aided reasoners better know what they know than text-based counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in code generation. LLMs take as the input a prompt and output the code. A key question is how to make prompts (i.e., Prompting Techniques). Existing prompting techniques are designed for natural language generation and have low accuracy in code generation. In this paper, we propose a new prompting technique named AceCoder. Our motivation is that code generation meets two unique challenges (i.e., requirement understanding and code implementation). AceCoder contains two novel mechanisms (i.e., guided code generation and example retrieval) to solve these challenges. (1) Guided code generation asks LLMs first to analyze requirements and output an intermediate preliminary (e.g., test cases). The preliminary is used to clarify requirements and tell LLMs\"what to write\". (2) Example retrieval selects similar programs as examples in prompts, which provide lots of relevant content (e.g., algorithms, APIs) and teach LLMs\"how to write\". We apply AceCoder to three LLMs (e.g., Codex) and evaluate it on three public benchmarks using the Pass@k. Results show that AceCoder can significantly improve the performance of LLMs on code generation. (1) In terms of Pass@1, AceCoder outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 56.4% in MBPP, 70.7% in MBJP, and 88.4% in MBJSP. (2) AceCoder is effective in LLMs with different sizes (i.e., 6B to 13B) and different languages (i.e., Python, Java, and JavaScript). (3) Human evaluation shows human developers prefer programs from AceCoder.",

Nonetheless, the creation of precise LFs necessitates domain expertise and substantial endeavors. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs) have exhibited substantial potential across diverse tasks. However, the capacity of PLMs to autonomously formulate accurate LFs remains an underexplored domain. In this research, we address this gap by introducing DataSculpt, an interactive framework that harnesses PLMs for the automated generation of LFs. Within DataSculpt, we incorporate an array of prompting techniques, instance selection strategies, and LF filtration methods to explore the expansive design landscape. Ultimately, we conduct a thorough assessment of DataSculpt's performance on 12 real-world datasets, encompassing a range of tasks. This evaluation unveils both the strengths and limitations of contemporary PLMs in LF design.",

        "abstract": "Generating poetry and other creative open-ended texts has been a long-standing challenge in the field of Natural Language Processing. In this paper, we present an approach to fine-tuning Large Language Models, specifically OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 and Meta\u2019s OPT-125M, to generate haikus, a traditional form of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines and a total of 17 syllables. Our goal is to generate haikus that not only follow the traditional syllabic structure but also convey poetic imagery and evoke an emotional response in the reader. We evaluate our approach based on perplexity metrics in addition to qualitative human evaluation. We believe that our approach opens up new possibilities for using Large Language Models to generate creative and emotionally resonant text; our results show us that while it can be difficult for models to learn the structure of the haiku, they are surprisingly poetic after being fine-tuned on tens of thousands of haikus and using certain sampling and prompting techniques.",

This approach was used in order to examine potential differences between gifted and average-ability children in relation to progression after training, and with regard to the question whether training children in analogy problem-solving elicits transfer of analogical reasoning skills to an analogy construction-task. Children were allocated to one of two experimental conditions: either children received unguided practice in analogy problem-solving, or they were provided with this in addition to training incorporating graduated prompting techniques. The results showed that gifted and average-ability children who were trained made more progress in analogy problem-solving than their peers who received unguided practice experiences only. Gifted and average-ability children were found to show similar progression in analogy problem-solving, and gifted children did not appear to have an advantage in the analogy-construction transfer task. The dynamic training seemed to bring about no additional improvement on the transfer task over that of unguided practice experiences only.",

        "abstract": "While forward reasoning (i.e. find the answer given the question) has been explored extensively in the recent literature, backward reasoning is relatively unexplored. We examine the backward reasoning capabilities of LLMs on Math Word Problems (MWPs): given a mathematical question and its answer, with some details omitted from the question, can LLMs effectively retrieve the missing information? In this paper, we formally define the backward reasoning task on math word problems and modify three datasets to evaluate this task: GSM8k, SVAMP and MultiArith. Our findings show a significant drop in the accuracy of models on backward reasoning compared to forward reasoning across four SOTA LLMs (GPT4, GPT3.5, PaLM-2, and LLaMa-2). Utilizing the specific format of this task, we propose three novel techniques that improve performance: Rephrase reformulates the given problem into a forward reasoning problem, PAL-Tools combines the idea of Program-Aided LLMs to produce a set of equations that can be solved by an external solver, and Check your Work exploits the availability of natural verifier of high accuracy in the forward direction, interleaving solving and verification steps. Finally, realizing that each of our base methods correctly solves a different set of problems, we propose a novel Bayesian formulation for creating an ensemble over these base methods aided by a verifier to further boost the accuracy by a significant margin. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our techniques successively improve the performance of LLMs on the backward reasoning task, with the final ensemble-based method resulting in a substantial performance gain compared to the raw LLMs with standard prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought.",

While recent vision-language models have made strides, they continue to struggle with zero-shot VQA, particularly in handling complex compositional questions and adapting to new domains i.e. knowledge-based reasoning. This paper explores the use of various prompting strategies, focusing on the BLIP2 model, to enhance zero-shot VQA performance. We conduct a comprehensive investigation across several VQA datasets, examining the effectiveness of different question templates, the role of few-shot exemplars, the impact of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and the benefits of incorporating image captions as additional visual cues. Despite the varied outcomes, our findings demonstrate that carefully designed question templates and the integration of additional visual cues, like image captions, can contribute to improved VQA performance, especially when used in conjunction with few-shot examples. However, we also identify a limitation in the use of chain-of-thought rationalization, which negatively affects VQA accuracy. Our study thus provides critical insights into the potential of prompting for improving zero-shot VQA performance.",

Microcalcifications are the most common and often the only radiological indicator of early breast cancer. Computer Aided Diagnosis (CADx) prompting techniques that alert radiologists to potential microcalcification abnormalities for re-examination have been demonstrated by several research groups to significantly improve the ability of radiologists to detect clustered microcalcifications. Very little research work has been performed to date to evaluate the performance of microcalcification detection techniques on a common set of images under controlled conditions. We have performed such a comparison on two promising methods from the research literature and four novel methods developed as a part of the work for this thesis. Additionally, the performance of these microcalcification detection methods are evaluated against criteria for the task of prompting screening radiologists for microcalcification cluster. As a part of this thesis work, an improved prototype of the Analytical Imaging Mammography (AIM) system was designed and constructed. This system is intended to provide a flexible platform for mammogram film digitization and analysis. Improvements in the ATM system included: (i) novel hardware and software for automatic, computerized focus and camera position control and (ii) a versatile, friendly user interface. The ATM system was used to digitize an extensive database of mammogram film images obtained from the B.C. Cancer Agency covering the full spectrum of mammographic abnormalities. A sub-set of 30 of these images were selected and used to evaluate the performance of the microcalcification detection methods implemented as a part of this thesis.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT) have shown impressive performance in code generation. LLMs take prompts as inputs, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is the state-of-the-art prompting technique. CoT prompting asks LLMs first to generate CoTs (i.e., intermediate natural language reasoning steps) and then output the code. However, CoT prompting is designed for natural language generation and has low accuracy in code generation. In this paper, we propose Structured CoTs (SCoTs) and present a novel prompting technique for code generation, named SCoT prompting. Our motivation is source code contains rich structural information and any code can be composed of three program structures (i.e., sequence, branch, and loop structures). Intuitively, structured intermediate reasoning steps make for structured source code. Thus, we ask LLMs to use program structures to build CoTs, obtaining SCoTs. Then, LLMs generate the final code based on SCoTs. Compared to CoT prompting, SCoT prompting explicitly constrains LLMs to think about how to solve requirements from the view of source code and further the performance of LLMs in code generation. We apply SCoT prompting to two LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT and Codex) and evaluate it on three benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, and MBCPP). (1) SCoT prompting outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline - CoT prompting by up to 13.79% in Pass@1. (2) Human evaluation shows human developers prefer programs from SCoT prompting. (3) SCoT prompting is robust to examples and achieves substantial improvements.",

This paper investigates the feasibility of enabling versatile conversational interactions with mobile UIs using a single LLM. We designed prompting techniques to adapt an LLM to mobile UIs.

In this paper, we formalize diversity of representation in generative LLMs. We present evaluation datasets and propose metrics to measure diversity in generated responses along people and culture axes. We find that LLMs understand the notion of diversity, and that they can reason and critique their own responses for that goal. This finding motivated a new prompting technique called collective-critique and self-voting (CCSV) to self-improve people diversity of LLMs by tapping into its diversity reasoning capabilities, without relying on handcrafted examples or prompt tuning. Extensive empirical experiments with both human and automated evaluations show that our proposed approach is effective at improving people and culture diversity, and outperforms all baseline methods by a large margin.",

        "abstract": "The long-standing problem related to prompt analyses in continuous air sampling or monitoring has been the well-known interference of the radon- and thoron-progeny co-deposited on the filtration media with any potential suspect radionuclides. The solutions to this problem have been quite diverse, and have included, for example, simple gross-alpha screening, the use of beta-to-alpha ratios, and/or the use of alpha spectral analyses. In the context of week-long retrospective continuous air sampling, this paper will explain, in detail, the technical basis for the use of the simple gross-alpha screening, beta-to-alpha ratio, and alpha spectrometry techniques and demonstrate the efficacy (or lack thereof) of these methods with simple examples. Although the most sensitive analysis technique for week-long retrospective continuous air samples is no doubt a long-lived count performed typically after at least a four-day decay period, when necessary, certain prompt and semi-prompt techniques discussed here can approach a sensitivity that is within about an order of magnitude of the long-lived count.",

        "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities in image-level visual perception. However, these models have shown limited performance in instance-level tasks that demand precise localization and recognition. Previous works have suggested that incorporating visual prompts, such as colorful boxes or circles, can improve the ability of models to recognize objects of interest. Nonetheless, compared to language prompting, visual prompting designs are rarely explored. Existing approaches, which employ coarse visual cues such as colorful boxes or circles, often result in sub-optimal performance due to the inclusion of irrelevant and noisy pixels. In this paper, we carefully study the visual prompting designs by exploring more fine-grained markings, such as segmentation masks and their variations. In addition, we introduce a new zero-shot framework that leverages pixel-level annotations acquired from a generalist segmentation model for fine-grained visual prompting. Consequently, our investigation reveals that a straightforward application of blur outside the target mask, referred to as the Blur Reverse Mask, exhibits exceptional effectiveness. This proposed prompting strategy leverages the precise mask annotations to reduce focus on weakly related regions while retaining spatial coherence between the target and the surrounding background. Our Fine-Grained Visual Prompting (FGVP) demonstrates superior performance in zero-shot comprehension of referring expressions on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks. It outperforms prior methods by an average margin of 3.0% to 4.6%, with a maximum improvement of 12.5% on the RefCOCO+ testA subset. The part detection experiments conducted on the PACO dataset further validate the preponderance of FGVP over existing visual prompting techniques. Code and models will be made available.",

StudentEval contains 1,749 prompts for 48 problems, written by 80 students who have only completed one semester of Python programming. Our students wrote these prompts while working interactively with a Code LLM, and we observed very mixed success rates. We use StudentEval to evaluate 5 Code LLMs and find that StudentEval is a better discriminator of model performance than existing benchmarks. We analyze the prompts and find significant variation in students' prompting techniques. We also find that nondeterministic LLM sampling could mislead students into thinking that their prompts are more (or less) effective than they actually are, which has implications for how to teach with Code LLMs.",

The purpose of this study is to discover the relationship between the scientific method and learning outcomes in the reaction rate material by using the probing prompting technique and the issue based learning model alone or combination. Quantitative research using correlational methodologies and a one-shot case study design is the approach of choice. Class XI MIPA SMAN 1 Padang and XI MIPA SMAN 14 Padang were the subjects of this research. A total of 144 persons were selected for the study using a simple random sampling technique. Questionnaires and learning outcomes assessments in the form of 22 objective questions that had been verified for validity and reliability were used in this study. The results found a positive and significant correlation between: 1) the scientific approach to learning outcomes using the probing prompting technique, with a correlation coefficient of 0.903 suggesting a very strong correlation. This suggests that by using the probing prompting technique, the scientific approach module can improve learning results by 81.5 percent. 2) A scientific approach to learning outcomes using a problem-based learning model with a correlation coefficient of 0.770, suggesting a strong link. This suggests that the scientific approach module, when combined with a problem-based learning model, has an effective contribution of 59.3 percent in improving learning outcomes. 3) Using the probing prompting technique and the issue based learning model together on the reaction rate learning outcomes yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.958, indicating a very strong correlation. The contribution of the two independent variables to the dependent variable in this study is 91.8 percent, with the remainder impacted by other variables.

As to rocket aerodynamics, computational methods and programs (CMPs) were developed to calculate supersonic flow past finned rockets. The chief advantage of the CMPs developed is computational promptness and ease of adding wings and control and stabilization elements to rocket configurations. A mathematical simulation of the aerogas thermodynamics of a supersonic ramjet vehicle yielded new results, which made it possible to develop a prompt technique for a comprehensive calculation of ramjet duct flows and generalize it to 3D flow past a ramjet vehicle. Based on marching methods, CMPs were developed to simulate ramjet duct flows with account for flow past the airframe upstream of the air inlet, the effect of the combustion product jet on the airframe tail part, and its interaction with a disturbed incident flow. The CMPs developed were recommended for use at the preliminary stage of ramjet component shape selection. For jet flows, CMPs were developed for the marching calculation of turbulent jets of rocket engine combustion products with water injection into the jet body. This made it possible to elucidate the basic mechanisms of the effect of water injection, jet\u2013air mixing, and high-temperature rocket engine jet afterburning in atmospheric oxygen on the flow pattern and the thermogas dynamic and thermalphysic jet parameters. CMPs were developed to simulate the operation of liquid-propellant low-thrust engine systems. They were used in supporting the development and ground firing tryout of Yuzhnoye State Design Office\u2019s radically new system of control jet engines fed from the sustainer engine pipelines of the Cyclone-4M launch vehicle upper stage. The computed results made it possible to increase the informativity of firing test data in flight simulation.

In this work, we examine what we can learn from language models' survey responses on the basis of the well-established American Community Survey (ACS) by the U.S. Census Bureau. Using a de-facto standard multiple-choice prompting technique and evaluating 40 different language models, hundreds of thousands of times each on questions from the ACS, we systematically establish two dominant patterns. First, models have significant position and labeling biases, for example, towards survey responses labeled with the letter\"A\". Second, when adjusting for labeling biases through randomized answer ordering, models across the board trend towards uniformly random survey responses. In fact, binary classifiers can almost perfectly differentiate between models' responses to the ACS and the responses of the US census. Taken together, our findings suggest caution in treating survey responses from language models as equivalent to those of human populations at present time.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the DSBA submissions to the Prompting Large Language Models as Explainable Metrics shared task, where systems were submitted to two tracks: small and large summarization tracks. With advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, evaluating the quality of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has become increasingly paramount. Traditional similarity-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE have shown to misalign with human evaluation and are ill-suited for open-ended generation tasks. To address this issue, we explore the potential capability of LLM-based metrics, especially leveraging open-source LLMs. In this study, wide range of prompts and prompting techniques are systematically analyzed with three approaches: prompting strategy, score aggregation, and explainability. Our research focuses on formulating effective prompt templates, determining the granularity of NLG quality scores and assessing the impact of in-context examples on LLM-based evaluation. Furthermore, three aggregation strategies are compared to identify the most reliable method for aggregating NLG quality scores. To examine explainability, we devise a strategy that generates rationales for the scores and analyzes the characteristics of the explanation produced by the open-source LLMs. Extensive experiments provide insights regarding evaluation capabilities of open-source LLMs and suggest effective prompting strategies.",

Previous research has focused primarily on video modeling techniques that required the student to watch an entire video of the task before attempting to complete the task independently. Video prompting is a form of video instruction that breaks down target skills into steps that are then performed directly after viewing each clip. The present review examined studies using video prompting techniques to teach functional and daily living skills to individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The focus of the review was on evaluation of the effectiveness of video prompting and the factors that affect student attention to the video, retention of target behavior, production of target behavior, and motivation. Results showed that video prompting was an effective intervention for teaching a wide array of target skills and that students with ASD were able to generalize and maintain the acquired skills. Video prompting was also shown to be more effective than both static picture prompts and video modeling techniques in terms of percentage of correct independent responding. Suggestions for practice and future research are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Graphs have emerged as a natural choice to represent and analyze the intricate patterns and rich information of the Web, enabling applications such as online page classification and social recommendation. The prevailing\"pre-train, fine-tune\"paradigm has been widely adopted in graph machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled nodes. However, this approach often exhibits a misalignment between the training objectives of pretext tasks and those of downstream tasks. This gap can result in the\"negative transfer\"problem, wherein the knowledge gained from pre-training adversely affects performance in the downstream tasks. The surge in prompt-based learning within Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests the potential of adapting a\"pre-train, prompt\"paradigm to graphs as an alternative. However, existing graph prompting techniques are tailored to homogeneous graphs, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of Web graphs. To bridge this gap, we propose HetGPT, a general post-training prompting framework to improve the predictive performance of pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The key is the design of a novel prompting function that integrates a virtual class prompt and a heterogeneous feature prompt, with the aim to reformulate downstream tasks to mirror pretext tasks. Moreover, HetGPT introduces a multi-view neighborhood aggregation mechanism, capturing the complex neighborhood structure in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate HetGPT's capability to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art HGNNs on semi-supervised node classification.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have limited performance when solving arithmetic reasoning tasks and often provide incorrect answers. Unlike natural language understanding, math problems typically have a single correct answer, making the task of generating accurate solutions more challenging for LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any LLMs that indicate their level of confidence in their responses which fuels a trust deficit in these models impeding their adoption. To address this deficiency, we propose \u2018MathPrompter\u2019, a technique that improves performance of LLMs on arithmetic problems along with increased reliance in the predictions. MathPrompter uses the Zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting technique to generate multiple algebraic expressions or python functions to solve the same math problem in different ways and thereby raise the confidence level in the output results. This is in contrast to other prompt based CoT methods, where there is no check on the validity of the intermediate steps followed.

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) equipped with techniques like chain-of-thought prompting have demonstrated impressive capabilities, they still fall short in their ability to reason robustly in complex settings. However, evaluating LLM reasoning is challenging because system capabilities continue to grow while benchmark datasets for tasks like logical deduction have remained static. We introduce MuSR, a dataset for evaluating language models on multistep soft reasoning tasks specified in a natural language narrative. This dataset has two crucial features. First, it is created through a novel neurosymbolic synthetic-to-natural generation algorithm, enabling the construction of complex reasoning instances that challenge GPT-4 (e.g., murder mysteries roughly 1000 words in length) and which can be scaled further as more capable LLMs are released. Second, our dataset instances are free text narratives corresponding to real-world domains of reasoning; this makes it simultaneously much more challenging than other synthetically-crafted benchmarks while remaining realistic and tractable for human annotators to solve with high accuracy. We evaluate a range of LLMs and prompting techniques on this dataset and characterize the gaps that remain for techniques like chain-of-thought to perform robust reasoning.",

        "abstract": "Current scientific fact-checking benchmarks exhibit several shortcomings, such as biases arising from crowd-sourced claims and an over-reliance on text-based evidence. We present SCITAB, a challenging evaluation dataset consisting of 1.2K expert-verified scientific claims that 1) originate from authentic scientific publications and 2) require compositional reasoning for verification. The claims are paired with evidence-containing scientific tables annotated with labels. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that SCITAB poses a significant challenge to state-of-the-art models, including table-based pretraining models and large language models. All models except GPT-4 achieved performance barely above random guessing. Popular prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought, do not achieve much performance gains on SCITAB. Our analysis uncovers several unique challenges posed by SCITAB, including table grounding, claim ambiguity, and compositional reasoning.

        "abstract": "We conduct a thorough investigation into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing specifically on the Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT) models as a representative of such models. Our study entails finetuning three different sizes of OPT on a carefully curated reasoning corpus, resulting in two sets of finetuned models: OPT-R, finetuned without explanations, and OPT-RE, finetuned with explanations. We then evaluate all models on 57 out-of-domain tasks drawn from the Super-NaturalInstructions benchmark, covering 26 distinct reasoning skills, utilizing three prompting techniques. Through a comprehensive grid of 27 configurations and 6,156 test evaluations, we investigate the dimensions of finetuning, prompting, and scale to understand the role of explanations on different reasoning skills. Our findings reveal that having explanations in the fewshot exemplar has no significant impact on the model\u2019s performance when the model is finetuned, while positively affecting the non-finetuned counterpart. Moreover, we observe a slight yet consistent increase in classification accuracy as we incorporate explanations during prompting and finetuning, respectively. Finally, we offer insights on which reasoning skills benefit the most from incorporating explanations during finetuning and prompting, such as Numerical (+20.4%) and Analogical (+13.9%) reasoning, as well as skills that exhibit negligible or negative effects.",

        "abstract": "Background\nPeritoneal dialysis (PD) is the RRT of choice in 15% of patients with CKD and has multiple advantages over hemodialysis. PD leaks can prompt technique failure and dropout. Use of peritoneal scintigraphy (PS) for diagnosis of PD leaks has declined in favor of more complex and expensive tests. We analyzed the utility of PS for PD leak diagnosis in our center.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively analyzed all PS done in our center from January 2000 until December 2018, inclusive, in all patients on PD with a suspected dialysate leak.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 39 PS procedures were done in 36 patients on PD in the study period. Of those, 81% were male and 11% had CKD due to polycystic kidney disease. During this period, 23 leaks were diagnosed, showing an incidence of 6% (three episodes per patient per year). In all cases with negative PS, other tests did not confirm a peritoneal dialysate leak.\n\n\nConclusions\nPS is a safe, inexpensive, reproducible, and highly effective diagnostic tool for peritoneal dialysate leaks that allows nephrologists to tailor or stop PD therapy if required. In our opinion, it should be the first-line imaging test to diagnose PD leaks with minimum exposure to radiation, contrast, or other substances that could irritate the peritoneal membrane. We believe PS should be considered as the initial test of choice to diagnose this PD complication as soon as possible, minimizing technique failure and dropout due to leaks.",

        "abstract": "Penelitian ini berawal dari keresahan penulis terhadap permasalahan yang terjadi di kelas VIII-9 SMP Negeri 49 Bandung terkait dengan keterampilan bertanya siswa dalam pembelajaran IPS. Permasalahan ini merupakan temuan dari observasi yang dilakukan pada beberapa kali pertemuan dalam rentang waktu bulan Februari sampai Mei 2015. Indikator permasalahan yang dijumpai adalah keterampilan bertanya siswa yang masih relatif rendah, dimana banyak pemberian materi yang diberikan guru sehingga yang tercipta dalam proses pembelajaran adalah seperti teacher centered. Kemudian siswa tidak terbiasa mengembangkan keterampilan bertanya yang dituangkan dalam pembelajaran IPS. Padahal pada prinsipnya belajar sambil melakukan (learning by doing) akan lebih memiliki daya ingat yang panjang, selain itu akan memperlihatkan sejauh mana siswa dapat membangun keterampilan bertanya. Meninjau permasalahan yang akan diteliti berkaitan dengan proses pembelajaran, maka peneliti memilih Penelitian Tindakan Kelas (PTK) dengan desain penelitian Kemiss dan Taggart dalam 2 siklus. Alternatif pemecahan masalah yang dipilih yaitu melalui penggunaan metode tanya jawab dengan teknik probing prompting dan Lembar Kegiatan Siswa (LKS) sesuai dengan tema pembelajaran diharapkan keterampilan bertanya siswa menjadi meningkat. Pelaksanaan kegiatan belajar menggunakan metode tanya jawab dengan teknik probing prompting sebagai alternatif meningkatkan keterampilan bertanya siswa dalam pembelajaran IPS dapat dikatakan berhasil. Adapun peningkatan keterampilan bertanya siswa dalam pembelajaran IPS dapat terlihat dari beberapa indikator yaitu mampu memberikan pertanyaan lanjutan yang akan mendorong siswa untuk lebih mendalami jawabannya terhadap pertanyaan sebelumnya, dapat menjawab pertanyaan atau mengungkapkan berdasarkan pemikirannya. Seluruh aspek tersebut mengalami perkembangan dari siklus pertama hingga siklus ketiga dari kualitas cukup, menjadi baik. Temuannya, penggunaan metode tanya jawab dengan teknik probing prompting dapat meningkatkan keterampilan bertanya siswa pada pembelajaran IPS. \n \nKata Kunci: Teknik Probing Prompting dan Keterampilan Bertanya Siswa \nThis research starts from the writer\u2019s anxiety over the problems of students\u2019 questioning skills in learning Social Studies in VIII-9 class at SMP Negeri 49 Bandung. These problems are found in the observation that has been conducted from February to May 2015. The indicators of problems encountered are the students\u2019 questioning skills which are still relatively low in which there are many learning materials provided by the teacher so that the learning process that is created is like \u2018teacher centered\u2019. Afterwards, the students are not accustomed to develop their questioning skills as outlined in learning Social Studies. Principally, learning by doing will increase students\u2019 memories; moreover, it will show the extent to which students can build their questioning skills. Considering the problems that will be examined regarding the learning process, the researcher chooses a Classroom Action Research(CAR) with Kemiss and Taggart research design in 2 cycles. The selected alternative solutions are through the use of question and answer method with probing prompting technique and Student Worksheet (SW) in accordance with the learning topic to improve the students\u2019 questioning skills. The implementation of learning activities using the question and answer method with probing prompting technique as an alternative to improve the students\u2019 questioning skills in learning Social Studies can be successful. The improvement of the students\u2019 questioning skills in learning Social Studies can be seen from some indicators such as the students are able to extend advanced questions that will encourage students to learn the answer of the previous question, moreover, they can answer the question or express the answer based on their thoughts. All of those aspects have evolved from the first to the third cycle, starting from sufficient to good quality. The findings reveal that the use of question and answer method with probing prompting technique can improve students\u2019 questioning skills in learning Social Studies. \n \nKeywords: Probing Prompting Technique and Students\u2019 Questioning Skills",

And yet, it is still under dispute whether LLMs possess similar reasoning abilities to humans. This study evaluates GPT-4 and various other LLMs in judging the profoundness of mundane, motivational, and pseudo-profound statements. We found a significant statement-to-statement correlation between the LLMs and humans, irrespective of the type of statements and the prompting technique used. However, LLMs systematically overestimate the profoundness of nonsensical statements, with the exception of Tk-instruct, which uniquely underestimates the profoundness of statements. Only few-shot learning prompts, as opposed to chain-of-thought prompting, draw LLMs ratings closer to humans. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the potential biases induced by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), inducing an increase in the bias to overestimate the profoundness of statements.",

        "abstract": "Cross-lingual Machine Translation (MT) quality estimation plays a crucial role in evaluating translation performance. GEMBA, the first MT quality assessment metric based on Large Language Models (LLMs), employs one-step prompting to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) in system-level MT quality estimation; however, it lacks segment-level analysis. In contrast, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting outperforms one-step prompting by offering improved reasoning and explainability. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge-Prompted Estimator (KPE), a CoT prompting method that combines three one-step prompting techniques, including perplexity, token-level similarity, and sentence-level similarity. This method attains enhanced performance for segment-level estimation compared with previous deep learning models and one-step prompting approaches. Furthermore, supplementary experiments on word-level visualized alignment demonstrate that our KPE method significantly improves token alignment compared with earlier models and provides better interpretability for MT quality estimation.

However, MultiCoNER II adds a fine-grained entity taxonomy with over 30 entity types and corrupted data on the test partitions. We approach these complications following prompt-based learning as (1) a ranking problem using a seq2seq framework, and (2) an extractive question-answering task.

A multiple baseline design was used with two groups of eleven classrooms. Results indicated that with onset of the intervention phase, moderate increases in energy conserving behaviors occurred in both clusters of classrooms. These findings indicate that prompting techniques are an effective strategy for getting lights turned off in classrooms. The conservation of electrical energy can be approached from two different perspectives: increasing the efficiency of equipment which is operated by electricity and the installation of automated equipment to eliminate waste on the one hand, and the modification of behavior patterns of people with respect to energy consumption. For maximum effectiveness, both approaches \u2014 the technical and the behavioral \u2014 have to be combined. While solely informational procedures have had only negligible effects on energy saving [1], incentive payments reducing energy use [2], and regular feedback seem to be strong behavioral procedures for inducing energy conservation [3].

        "abstract": "We explore the creative problem-solving capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs) in a constrained setting. The setting requires circumventing a cognitive bias known in psychology as ''functional fixedness'' to use familiar objects in innovative or unconventional ways. To this end, we create MacGyver, an automatically generated dataset consisting of 1,600 real-world problems that deliberately trigger functional fixedness and require thinking 'out-of-the-box'. We then present our collection of problems to both LLMs and humans to compare and contrast their problem-solving abilities. We show that MacGyver is challenging for both groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For example, humans typically excel in solving problems that they are familiar with but may struggle with tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge, leading to a higher variance. On the other hand, LLMs, being exposed to a variety of highly specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but are prone to overconfidence and propose actions that are physically infeasible or inefficient. We also provide a detailed error analysis of LLMs, and demonstrate the potential of enhancing their problem-solving ability with novel prompting techniques such as iterative step-wise reflection and divergent-convergent thinking. This work provides insight into the creative problem-solving capabilities of humans and AI and illustrates how psychological paradigms can be extended into large-scale tasks for comparing humans and machines.",

All test sessions were undertaken individually using a specially designed programme incorporating an electronic console and tangible materials equipped internally with sensors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs a consequence of training, children significantly outperformed controls on a number of series completion tasks. Significant individual differences were noted in terms of the children's response to assistance.

While a significant proportion of the children employed strategies that had earlier been identified as optimal, a sizeable minority demonstrated rather more idiosyncratic approaches.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFindings from the study demonstrate the potential value of electronic dynamic testing using graduated prompts.

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a prosperous development of dialogue response generation since the advent of Transformer [66]. Fine-tuning pretrained language models for different downstream tasks has become the dominant paradigm in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, fine-tuning requires storing a full copy of parameter states for every task, which is memory-consuming and expensive to serve when working with large-scale models with billions of parameters like GPT-3 [8]. Meanwhile, prompt-tuning has become an increasingly popular parameter-efficient method for steering large pretrained language models to various tasks. Most of the prompting techniques are applied in language understanding and assuming fixed prompts for all data samples within a task. Therefore, there arises an urgent need to exploit the ability of prompt-tuning in open-domain dialogue generation where data samples may vary greatly within a task. In this thesis, we present a novel, instance-specific prompt-tuning algorithm for dialogue generation. Specifically, we generate prompts based on instance-level control code, rather than the conversation context, to explore their impact on controlled dialogue generation. Experiments on popular open-domain dialogue datasets, evaluated with both automated metrics and human evaluation, demonstrate that our method is superior to prompting baselines as well as other lightweight controlled generation methods, and comparable to fine-tuning with less than 10% of total parameters.",

ProP implements a multi-step approach that combines a variety of prompting techniques to achieve this. Our results show that manual prompt curation is essential, that the LM must be encouraged to give answer sets of variable lengths, in particular including empty answer sets, that true/false questions are a useful device to increase precision on suggestions generated by the LM, that the size of the LM is a crucial factor, and that a dictionary of entity aliases improves the LM score.

        "abstract": "With the rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI), its potential implications for higher education have become a focal point of interest. This study delves into the capabilities of AI in Physics Education and offers actionable AI policy recommendations. Using a Large Language Model (LLM), we assessed its ability to answer 1337 Physics exam questions spanning GCSE, A-Level, and Introductory University curricula. We employed various AI prompting techniques: Zero Shot, In Context Learning, and Confirmatory Checking, which merges Chain of Thought reasoning with Reflection. The AI's proficiency varied across academic levels: it scored an average of 83.4% on GCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions, with an overall average of 59.9% using the most effective prompting technique. In a separate test, the LLM's accuracy on 5000 mathematical operations was found to decrease as the number of digits increased. Furthermore, when evaluated as a marking tool, the LLM's concordance with human markers averaged at 50.8%, with notable inaccuracies in marking straightforward questions, like multiple-choice. Given these results, our recommendations underscore caution: while current LLMs can consistently perform well on Physics questions at earlier educational stages, their efficacy diminishes with advanced content and complex calculations. LLM outputs often showcase novel methods not in the syllabus, excessive verbosity, and miscalculations in basic arithmetic. This suggests that at university, there's no substantial threat from LLMs for non-invigilated Physics questions. However, given the LLMs' considerable proficiency in writing Physics essays and coding abilities, non-invigilated examinations of these skills in Physics are highly vulnerable to automated completion by LLMs. This vulnerability also extends to Physics questions pitched at lower academic levels.",

Despite these efforts, a unified epistemological foundation is still conspicuously absent. Drawing inspiration from Kant's a priori philosophy, we propose the UPAR prompting framework, designed to emulate the structure of human cognition within LLMs. The UPAR framework is delineated into four phases:\"Understand\",\"Plan\",\"Act\", and\"Reflect\", enabling the extraction of structured information from complex contexts, prior planning of solutions, execution according to plan, and self-reflection. This structure significantly augments the explainability and accuracy of LLM inference, producing a human-understandable and inspectable inferential trajectory. Furthermore, our work offers an epistemological foundation for existing prompting techniques, allowing for a possible systematic integration of these methods. With GPT-4, our approach elevates the accuracy from COT baseline of 22.92% to 58.33% in a challenging subset of GSM8K, and from 67.91% to 75.40% in the causal judgment task.",

These findings prompted large efforts aiming to understand and measure such effects, with the goal of providing benchmarks that can guide the development of techniques mitigating these stereotypical associations. However, as recent research has pointed out, the current benchmarks lack a robust experimental setup, consequently hindering the inference of meaningful conclusions from their evaluation metrics. In this paper, we extend these arguments and demonstrate that existing techniques and benchmarks aiming to measure stereotypes tend to be inaccurate and consist of a high degree of experimental noise that severely limits the knowledge we can gain from benchmarking language models based on them. Accordingly, we propose a new framework for robustly measuring and quantifying biases exhibited by generative language models. Finally, we use this framework to investigate GPT-3's occupational gender bias and propose prompting techniques for mitigating these biases without the need for fine-tuning.",

(3) Untuk kegiatan refleksi dilakukan secara berkelanjutan, setelah dilaksanakannya proses pembelajaran di kelas melalui penerapan teknik probing prompting. Dimana melalui penerapan teknik probing prompting mampu meningkatkan partisipasi siswa dalam proses pembelajaran IPS. Hal ini dibuktikan dengan hasil peningkatan partisipasi siswa dalam setiap siklusnya. Adapun pada siklus Ipeningkatan partisipasi siswa sekitar 53,55% yang termasuk kategori cukup, pada siklus II meningkat menjadi 77,93% yang termasuk kategori baik, pada siklus III naik menjadi 88,89% yang tetap pada kategori baik. Oleh karena itu, penerapan teknik probing prompting dapat meningkatkan partisipasi siswa dalam proses pembelajaran IPS.; The background of this research is a problem that occurred in VII-A class which was students\u2019 low participation while learning Social Science in school was on going, there were only one or two students who declared their opinion, responded to their friends\u2019 opinion, andasked and answered a question. In order to solve this problem, the researcher implemented Probing Prompting technique to increase students\u2019 participation.This research used Action Research as the method with qualitative and quantitative approach which was done only in three phases, because the researcher found that the objective of the research had been accomplished at the third phase. The results show that (1) The planning of Probing Prompting technique can be implemented well, proved by the quality of their learning process which was increasing. (2) The implementation of Probing Prompting technique in Social Science Classroom has been able to increase students\u2019 participation, proving that there is an effect between the teaching process performed by the teacher with students\u2019 participation in the learning process. (3) To reflect the activities carried out in a sustainable manner, after the implementation of the learning process in the classroom through the implementation of Probing Prompting technique, this technique is able toincrease student\u2019s participation in Social Science learning process.

        "abstract": "Personalized content-based recommender systems have become indispensable tools for users to navigate through the vast amount of content available on platforms like daily news websites and book recommendation services. However, existing recommenders face significant challenges in understanding the content of items. Large language models (LLMs), which possess deep semantic comprehension and extensive knowledge from pretraining, have proven to be effective in various natural language processing tasks. In this study, we explore the potential of leveraging both open- and closed-source LLMs to enhance content-based recommendation. With open-source LLMs, we utilize their deep layers as content encoders, enriching the representation of content at the embedding level. For closed-source LLMs, we employ prompting techniques to enrich the training data at the token level. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the high effectiveness of both types of LLMs and show the synergistic relationship between them. Notably, we observed a significant relative improvement of up to 19.32% compared to existing state-of-the-art recommendation models. These findings highlight the immense potential of both open- and closed-source of LLMs in enhancing content-based recommendation systems. We will make our code and LLM-generated data available for other researchers to reproduce our results.",

        "abstract": "Following the development of cue fading as an adjunct to discrimination training with lower animals (Terrace, 1963a, 1963b, 1963c, 1964, 1966) it seemed valuable to utilize cue-fading (prompting) techniques with children. Because educational institutions offer the major source of child subjects and because such institutions can provide only limited and temporary space, it seemed desirable to consider a relatively simple, portable, and flexibly programmed apparatus for presenting prompted stimulus materials. Such an apparatus should allow for: (1) presentation of visual stimuli which can be progressively varied along a prompting dimension; (2) adjustment, during training, of the number and size of prompt steps in a prompting progression; and, (3) repetition or interruption of any part of a prompting progression at any time during training. The latter two requirements can be met in one of two ways: (1) many series of stimuli must be prepared which progress through the prompting dimension in a wide variety of steps and step sizes (successful cue fading with children has been obtained under these conditions: Acker, 1966; Sidman and Stoddard, 1967; Touchette, 1968; Gollin and Savoy, 1968); or (2) the training apparatus must be capable of making these changes in the prompting progression independently of the stimuli (Moore and Goldiamond, 1964). The present system utilizes the latter method, thus providing a more immediate and economical means of adjusting the prompting progression to suit the immediate needs of the experiment. The present system utilizes a focus difference between two stimuli (S+ and S-) to prompt a correct choice of S+ [Israel (1960), successfully used variable blurring to prompt recall of the second member in a pairedassociate learning task]. Two Kodak Carousel, 35-mm projectors (model No. AV900) with remote control are used to present the stimulus. Using one projector for presenting Sand the other for S+, a focus difference (prompt) between the two stimuli can be created. For example, keeping S+ in focus it is possible to present a series of S-s which progresses from extremely out-offocus to in-focus over trials. The number and size of steps in such a progression is immediately adjustable",

        "abstract": "Recalling specific past experiences is critical for most formal social interactions, including when being interviewed for employment, as a witness or defendant in the criminal justice system, or as a patient during a clinical consultation. Such interviews can be difficult for autistic adults under standard open questioning, yet applied research into effective methods to facilitate autistic adults\u2019 recall is only recently beginning to emerge. The current study tested the efficacy of different prompting techniques to support autistic adults\u2019 recall of specific personal memories; 30 autistic and 30 typically developing adults (intelligence quotients\u2009>\u200985) were asked to recall specific instances from their past, relevant to criminal justice system, healthcare, and employment interviews. Questions comprised \u2018open questions\u2019, \u2018semantic prompting\u2019 (where semantic knowledge was used to prompt specific episodic retrieval) and \u2018visual\u2013verbal prompting\u2019 (a pie-diagram with prompts to recall specific details, for example, who, what, and where). Half the participants received the questions in advance. Consistent with previous research, autistic participants reported memories with reduced specificity. For both groups, visual\u2013verbal prompting support improved specificity and episodic relevance, while semantic prompting also aided recall for employment questions (but not health or criminal justice system). Findings offer new practical insight for interviewers to facilitate communication with typically developing and autistic adults. Lay abstract During many types of interviews (e.g. in employment, with the police, and in healthcare), we need to recall detailed memories of specific events, which can be difficult for autistic people in response to commonly used questions. This is especially because these tend to be open questions (i.e. very broad). Autistic people have disproportionately high rates of physical and mental health conditions, are more likely to interact with police, and are the most underemployed disability group. However, interviewers are often unsure about how to adapt their communication for autistic people. Our research tested whether different types of prompts enabled autistic people to recall specific memories (memories of a single event within one day). Participants were asked about situations relating to witnessing a crime (e.g. at the bank), physical or mental health scenarios and employment interviews (e.g. a time you\u2019ve met a deadline). We tested the following: Open questions: basic questions only (e.g. \u2018tell me about a time you went to the cinema\u2019), Semantic prompting: a general prompt (e.g. \u2018do you enjoy going to the cinema?\u2019) before asking for a specific instance (\u2018tell me about a time you went to the cinema?\u2019), Visual\u2013verbal prompting: asking participants to recall when it happened, who was there, the actions that occurred, the setting, and any objects. With visual\u2013verbal prompting, autistic and typically developing participants\u2019 memories were more specific and detailed. Semantic prompting was also effective for employment questions. Our study shows that autistic people can recall specific memories when they are appropriately prompted. Visual\u2013verbal prompting may be effective across different situations.",

The prompts used by companies to guide their models are often treated as secrets, to be hidden from the user making the query. They have even been treated as commodities to be bought and sold. However, there has been anecdotal evidence showing that the prompts can be extracted by a user even when they are kept secret. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically measuring the success of prompt extraction attacks.

This technique can encourage students\u2019 metacognition abilities in solving mathematical problems. This study aims to determine the development of students\u2019 metacognition in mathematical problem-solving. This classroom action research applied a qualitative descriptive method which was carried out in five cycles, involving four out of 22 Year 7 students in one of the islamic junior high schools in Aceh Besar, Indonesia. Data analysis of students\u2019 metacognition development was investigated through metacognition question sheets which were carried out after solving mathematical problem solving problems. Students\u2019 and teacher\u2019s activities were investigated in each lesson. The results showed that the students\u2019 metacognition in mathematical problem-solving increased in Cycle I to V based on metacognition question sheets, students\u2019 activity sheets, and teacher\u2019s observation sheets in using probing prompting techniques. The development of students\u2019 metacognition can also be seen through other supporting aspects, such as students\u2019 activities and teacher\u2019s efforts in the learning, both increased in each cycle. The results also showed that students\u2019 metacognition increased with the increase in student activities and teacher teaching abilities.",

These models with upwards of hundreds of billions of parameters are trained on large unlabeled text corpora and can subsequently solve downstream tasks with little to no labeled data. While these models are increasingly versatile in their abilities, e.g., solving math word problems, the larger question of their ability to reason remains. Using and modifying the SVAMP dataset, we find that GPT-3\u2019s davinci-002 model, in addition to having good performance on numerical math word problems, also performs well on the potentially harder symbolic version of the same problems. Furthermore, adopting a two-step approach (solve symbolically and then substitute numerical values) leads to better accuracy on the numerical test set in the zero-shot regime. Additionally, we find that the use of specific prompting techniques pushes the model, in many cases, to actively describe its thought process and aid in the final answer output when faced with a complex, multi-step problem, aligning with recent observations.",

In particular, language models can be queried similar to knowledge graphs. The performance of the relational fact extraction task depends signi\ufb01cantly on the query sentence, also known under the term prompt . Tuning these prompts has shown to increase the precision on standard language models by a maximum of around 12% points. However, usually large amounts of data in the form of existing knowledge graph facts and large text corpora are needed to train the required additional model. In this work, we propose using a completely di\ufb00erent approach: Instead of spending resources on training an additional model, we simply perform an adaptive \ufb01ne-tuning of the pre-trained language model on the standard \ufb01ll-mask task using a small training dataset of existing facts from a knowledge graph. We investigate the di\ufb00erences between complex prompting techniques and adaptive \ufb01ne-tuning in an extensive evaluation. Remarkably, adaptive \ufb01ne-tuning outperforms all baselines, even by using signi\ufb01cantly fewer training facts. Additionally, we analyze the transfer learning capabilities of this adapted language model by training on a restricted set of relations to show that even fewer training relations are needed to achieve high knowledge extraction quality.",

        "abstract": "The revolution of artificial intelligence content generation has been rapidly accelerated with the booming text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. Within just two years of development, it was unprecedentedly of high-quality, diversity, and creativity that the state-of-the-art models could generate. However, a prevalent limitation persists in the effective communication with these popular T2I models, such as Stable Diffusion, using natural language descriptions. This typically makes an engaging image hard to obtain without expertise in prompt engineering with complex word compositions, magic tags, and annotations. Inspired by the recently released DALLE3 - a T2I model directly built-in ChatGPT that talks human language, we revisit the existing T2I systems endeavoring to align human intent and introduce a new task - interactive text to image (iT2I), where people can interact with LLM for interleaved high-quality image generation/edit/refinement and question answering with stronger images and text correspondences using natural language. In addressing the iT2I problem, we present a simple approach that augments LLMs for iT2I with prompting techniques and off-the-shelf T2I models. We evaluate our approach for iT2I in a variety of common-used scenarios under different LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, LLAMA, Baichuan, and InternLM. We demonstrate that our approach could be a convenient and low-cost way to introduce the iT2I ability for any existing LLMs and any text-to-image models without any training while bringing little degradation on LLMs' inherent capabilities in, e.g., question answering and code generation. We hope this work could draw broader attention and provide inspiration for boosting user experience in human-machine interactions alongside the image quality of the next-generation T2I systems.",

Task analysis may be a useful tool for teachers of students with ASD to build literacy skills by aligning instruction in missing skills to the curriculum standards. The steps to consider when using a task analysis include what emergent literacy skills will be taught, defining expected steps and correct responses, the instructional method to be used, systematic prompting techniques, piloting and updating the task analysis, and teaching and collecting data.

        "abstract": "Large-scale foundation models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable success in visual recognition tasks by embedding images in a semantically rich space. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has also shown promise in improving visual recognition by learning invariant features. However, the combination of CLIP with SSL is found to face challenges due to the multi-task framework that blends CLIP's contrastive loss and SSL's loss, including difficulties with loss weighting and inconsistency among different views of images in CLIP's output space. To overcome these challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based model called GOPro, which is a unified framework that ensures similarity between various augmented views of input images in a shared image-text embedding space, using a pair of learnable image and text projectors atop CLIP, to promote invariance and generalizability. To automatically learn such prompts, we leverage the visual content and style primitives extracted from pre-trained CLIP and adapt them to the target task. In addition to CLIP's cross-domain contrastive loss, we introduce a visual contrastive loss and a novel prompt consistency loss, considering the different views of the images. GOPro is trained end-to-end on all three loss objectives, combining the strengths of CLIP and SSL in a principled manner. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GOPro outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting techniques on three challenging domain generalization tasks across multiple benchmarks by a significant margin.

In this paper, we help fill this gap by proposing AutoMQM, a prompting technique which leverages the reasoning and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and asks them to identify and categorize errors in translations. We start by evaluating recent LLMs, such as PaLM and PaLM-2, through simple score prediction prompting, and we study the impact of labeled data through in-context learning and finetuning. We then evaluate AutoMQM with PaLM-2 models, and we find that it improves performance compared to just prompting for scores (with particularly large gains for larger models) while providing interpretability through error spans that align with human annotations.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention across various research disciplines, including the wireless communication community. There have been several heated discussions on the intersection of LLMs and wireless technologies. While recent studies have demonstrated the ability of LLMs to generate hardware description language (HDL) code for simple computation tasks, developing wireless prototypes and products via HDL poses far greater challenges because of the more complex computation tasks involved. In this paper, we aim to address this challenge by investigating the role of LLMs in FPGA-based hardware development for advanced wireless signal processing. We begin by exploring LLM-assisted code refactoring, reuse, and validation, using an open-source software-defined radio (SDR) project as a case study. Through the case study, we find that an LLM assistant can potentially yield substantial productivity gains for researchers and developers. We then examine the feasibility of using LLMs to generate HDL code for advanced wireless signal processing, using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm as an example. This task presents two unique challenges: the scheduling of subtasks within the overall task and the multi-step thinking required to solve certain arithmetic problem within the task. To address these challenges, we employ in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques, culminating in the successful generation of a 64-point Verilog FFT module. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLMs for generalization and imitation, affirming their usefulness in writing HDL code for wireless communication systems. Overall, this work contributes to understanding the role of LLMs in wireless communication and motivates further exploration of their capabilities.",
